The current study aims to model competitiveness and comparison between two closed-loop three-level supply chains, each of which includes a manufacturer, a retailer, and a third party to collect the products used by the customer, taking into account the concepts of game theory and the existence of aggregates. Moreover, a separate supplier for each chain is considered. In the forward supply chain, the manufacturer produces new products using new components or re-used products that have been collected from the consumer, then sells these products mainly to the retailer, and the retailer sells them. In the reverse chain, the collector provides the used products to the manufacturer after collection. The study utilized the definitions and concepts of game theory to model this closed loop chain as a Stackelberg game to obtain the optimal value of wholesale and retail price and the optimal value of the product return coefficient for the collector. Finally, the models based on some numerical examples are solved. Given the results, the remanufacturing costs have a significant role in making more profits for all members in such chains, and competitive chains should attempt to remanufacture the products at lower costs.  © 2022 Nguyen Dinh Trung et al., published by Sciendo.",Closed-loop supply chain; game theory; out-of-chain competition; reverse logistics; Stackelberg game,Cell proliferation; Environmental regulations; Inverse problems; Linear matrix inequalities; Optimal systems; Sales; Supply chains; Closed-loop; Closed-loop supply chain; Economic advantages; Environmental problems; Industry research; Optimal values; Out-of-chain competition; Reverse logistics; Stackelberg Games; Used product; Game theory,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144205668

In line with e-commerce growth, product returns increased to double-digit percentages, constituting a risk for the retailer’s profitability. The main cause lies within product uncertainty, as consumers cannot physically assess and try on products. Previous research differentiates between product quality and fit uncertainty, where the latter has a stronger effect on product returns. To counteract, retailers can implement signals to convey additional product information. While quality-inferring signals, such as brands, have been studied extensively, little is known about signals supporting product fit. We research a technology specifically designed to reduce fit uncertainty, namely virtual try-ons (VTOs), exploring how their usage impacts consumer purchase behavior, especially sales and returns, considering different product types. The analysis is based on a unique clickstream and customer transaction dataset from a European e-commerce retailer comprising over 1.3 million purchases in 2020. Results indicate that the usage of VTOs increases sales, in particular order value, the number of items per order, average selling prices, and contribution margins, as well as reduces returns. These relationships are fortified for hedonic vs. utilitarian goods. We validate previously posed hypotheses that interactive technologies perform better in serving retailers’ desired outcomes than static decision aids, indicating that these provide superior product fit information, function as a signal, and hence reduce online product uncertainty more effectively. We are among the firsts to analyze the influence of try-on technology usage on purchasing behavior and extend Expectation-Disconfirmation and Signaling theory to the digital marketing context. Moreover, we contribute methodologically by analyzing large-scale data, adding realism to technology usage studies, which primarily leverage purchase intentions and laboratory settings. Further, marketers can gain a better understanding of customer interactions with a new technology that promotes beneficial top-and bottom-line implications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Consumer purchasing behavior; E-commerce; Product uncertainty; Virtual try-on,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151236694

Online retailers with online sales channels consider whether to provide return policies and whether to provide consumers with return insurance. The research established four return strategy models that: do not provide returns; provide returns but do not provide return insurance; provide return insurance, but the cost is borne by online retailers; and provide return insurance, but the cost is borne by consumers. The authors then studied the online retailers’ optimal return and shipping insurance selection strategies. The results show that when the proportion of residual return value after the value reduction of unit returned products was large, online retailers set higher sales prices and provided return policies, while offline retailers needed to reduce sales prices in order to attract more consumers. When the consumer unit product return compensation was relatively large, online retailers chose to provide consumers with free return insurance; otherwise, it was more beneficial for online retailers not to provide return insurance. Further research found that although the cost of online retailers increased when freight insurance was taken, it could better attract consumers, which was more beneficial to online retailers. © 2022 by the authors.",consumer purchase behavior; online retailer; return insurance; return strategy,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144851926

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of integrated halal supply chain (IHSC) strategies on effective product returns with halal logistics (HL) as an interceding variable. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used the cross-sectional technique to select samples from a population that revolved around the halal food industry in Malaysia. Data collected from halal service providers who handle halal frozen meat product returns provided insightful findings. Findings: The findings of this paper indicate that the IHSC dimensions, such as interactive fairness, procedural fairness and service coverage, are positively associated with effective product returns. It also shows that HL plays a mediating role between the IHSC and effective product returns. Practical implications: From a practical viewpoint, this paper suggests that an effective return service system can be designed to emphasise the category of interactive and flexible justice services through refunds or product replacement, depending on customer's demand. Originality/value: The result of this paper provides insights into how logistics service provider managers effectively and efficiently handle the halal supply chain network when involving product returns. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Frozen meat; Halal integration; Halal logistics; Halal supply chain; Product returns,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129226144

We find the Matthew effect of whether or not to use blockchain is evident, with the pros and cons accumulating over time. However, the platform without blockchain is not always a loser, even if it is just a follower or myopic decision-maker, related to critical factors such as supply and demand level, platform differentiation, the strength of network effects.

However, providing virtual reality may create new challenges. For instance, consumers may obtain essential information about products by using virtual reality option, but eventually they buy their products from the offline channel. This phenomenon is called webrooming. Another challenge is cyber-attacks. E-tailers and their consumers face risks from cyber-attacks. Thus, e-tailers are investing to improve cybersecurity. We consider a dual-channel supply chain consisting of an offline retailer and an e-tailer who purchase the same product from a manufacturer at the same wholesale price. The e-tailer offers a partial refund policy in order to attract the customers. Also, to reduce consumer valuation uncertainty, the e-tailer faces the decision on whether to introduce virtual reality. We analyze three scenarios. Firstly, the e-tailer does not offer virtual reality. Secondly, the e-tailer offers virtual reality, but he does not invest on cybersecurity. Thirdly, the e-tailer offers virtual reality and invests on cybersecurity. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cybersecurity; Game theory; Pricing; Return policy; Virtual reality; Webrooming,Computer crime; Costs; Crime; Cybersecurity; Network security; Sales; Supply chains; Virtual reality; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Dual-channel supply chains; E-tailers; Game-theoretic; New options; Offline channel; Offline retailers; Return policy; Webrooming; Game theory,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152560679

Researchers have contributed to this field by borrowing theories from sustainable business research. However, there is a lack of literature reviewing the development and contribution of reverse logistics studies in organisational and management theories. By identifying the most frequently used management theories, this paper fills the gap and describes the theoretical contribution of reverse logistics papers to organisational and management theories. Methods: Using the vote-counting technique, this article reviews 122 papers published between 2005 and 2021 to assess how organisational and management theories developed in the studies of reverse logistics. Results: The analysis indicates that, while some, such as triple bottom line and critical success factors, have been frequently employed, the relation between reverse logistics and sustainability and other organisational theories remain undeveloped. It also discovered that the research topics only focused on product and material recycling, but few on product return and exchange logistics. Conclusions: First, there is a huge gap in organisational and management theories and reverse logistics studies. It is suggested that scholars involved in reverse logistics studies can explore more connections between reverse logistics strategies and management theories in future research. Second, more theories should be used in addition to triple bottom line and critical success factors in reverse logistics research. Furthermore, although some incorporated other factors into the management theories and developed a framework after examining their interrelationship, little contribution has been made to the theories themselves. Additionally, more discussion of reverse logistics in the field can focus on product return and exchange logistics. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.",organisational and management theories; reverse logistics; sustainability; systematic literature review; theories development,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153595190

To this end, reverse logistics in streamlining a circular economy (take, make, use, reuse, repair, and recycle) catapulted to the top of the discussion for collecting and distributing products. Yet, little is empirically known about the role of reverse logistics in the circular economy. This study attempts to fill this knowledge gap in theory and practice through a multiple case study approach including 40 semi-structured interviews with reverse logistics specialists from the four largest retailing firms in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Findings reveal multiple ways by which reverse logistics contributes to a circular economy: for instance, reverse logistics enables firms to develop a circular product design; the combination of reverse flow with the forward flow consolidates the high volume of products, thus mitigating waste; use of innovative tools (robots, autonomous bikes) in reverse logistics increases the used products’ return rate and thereby enhancing recycling; technological advances (e.g. big data and IoT) in reverse logistics help trace the product thus reducing waste. The paper offers several valuable insights for practitioners to build a circular economy via reverse logistics (waste reduction, responsible consumption, and sustainable logistics).

Recovery of residual value from product returns also helps in achieving sustainability. Its successful implementation requires coordination among all the channel members involved in the activities, from the acquisition to collection to the disposition of returned products. This article aims to review the literature about coordination issues in the RSC. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of 151 articles published during 2004–2021 is carried out. Theory, context and methodology (TCM) framework of the literature review is used to identify the research gaps for future research directions. Findings: This study identifies the characteristics of RSC coordination. It includes channel structures; coordination mechanisms; performance measuring parameters; the methodology applied and explored industries. The review shows that game-theoretical modeling in RSC coordination is the most commonly used method to coordinate the channels. It was found that issues like disruption, fairness and corporate social responsibility are not explored in-depth and offer much potential for future research. Originality/value: There are very limited studies on coordination issues in the RSC.

The retailer also manages online product returns by selecting appropriate return policies. A robust omnichannel pricing and ordering optimization model is proposed with two, i.e., a full-refund and a no-refund, return policies. The online demand and the offline demand depend on the prices of the e-store and the brick-and-mortar stores, where the online demand also depends on the refund of the e-store. A linearization technique is adopted to deal with nonlinearity of the model. A data-driven robust optimization approach is used to construct uncertainty sets based on available historical data using support vector clustering to handle demand uncertainties. Furthermore, the proposed model is transformed into an approximate mixed integer linear programming model which can be solved by using commercial software. An electronics retailer in China is used as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model and the solution method. A comparison with the box uncertainty set reveals that the data-driven uncertainty set is less conservative and performs better by obtaining higher profit for the retailer. Furthermore, sensitive analysis results indicate that return policies and the return rate of the product affect the optimal pricing and ordering decisions and the total profit. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Data-driven robust optimization; Demand uncertainty; Omnichannel retailing; Pricing; Return policies,Costs; Integer programming; Mortar; Profitability; Sales; Support vector machines; Data driven; Data-driven robust optimization; Demand uncertainty; Omnichannel retailing; Optimization approach; Order optimizations; Return policy; Robust optimization; Support vector clustering; Uncertainty; Brick,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136762399

Also the use of eco-friendly products is essential in today's environment and human health. Thus this paper investigates the consumers' purchasing behaviour towards substitutable non-green and eco-friendly products in a dual-channel (offline and online channels) supply chain system. The manufacturer offers a novel combination of promotions such as a return policy in the online channel and a warranty policy in the offline channel depending on the position and situation of consumers. Here, the environmental burden is reduced by considering remanufacturing/refurbishing used products during the warranty period. Therefore, consumers' demand depends on price, eco-friendliness level, warranty and return agreements. The entire problem is modelled under centralised and decentralised decision-making scenarios. Finally, the profit maximisation problem is formulated and solved in the game theory framework. A series of sensitivity analyses of various parameters is conducted numerically to validate the problem. It is observed that, due to the instant return facility in the online channel, online demand is higher than the offline with a higher warranty period. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Dual-channel supply chain; remanufacturing/refurbishing activity; return policy; Stackelberg game; traditional and eco-friendly product; warranty policy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148477015

This article addresses this knowledge gap by analysing the case of Turkey, exploring how positions in the global migration regime and relations with countries of origin influence return policies. It first argues that Turkey’s geopolitical reasoning has led it to design an asylum regime, including repatriation and deportation procedures, centred on temporariness. Second, it contends that Turkey’s extraterritorial space-making strategies–namely, military intervention in Syria and humanitarian/development projects in Afghanistan–guide return policies. Examining the Turkish case contributes to our understanding of national returns governance in transit-turned-host countries, which increasingly emphasise repatriation over long-term protection. Finally, the paper contributes more generally to our understanding of the geopolitics of returns by focusing on specific mechanisms that link geopolitical concerns with policy instruments at the state level. © 2022 The Author(s).

This ecological context has compelled electronic firms to adopt reverse logistics (RL) and to invest in advanced technologies with a focus on sustainable recovery practices and on reducing excessive carbon emissions (CEs). This study proposes a multi-objective mixed integer programming (MOMIP) model for configuring a RL network design; it incorporates multiple products, multiple recovery facilities, multiple processing technologies, and a selection of vehicle types. The novelty of this study lies in its consideration of four green technologies (inspection, dismantling, repair/refurbishing, and recycling facilities), and its efforts to maximize return yield potential in the form of product, components, and material recovery. The main objective of the model is to minimize overall RL network cost and environmental impact due to processing and transportation. Further, a weighted goal programming technique is used to determine efficient solutions and furnish a trade-off among the conflicting objectives. The mathematical model is validated utilizing a real life case study of an electronics manufacturing firm in India. The total RL network cost and emissions are both reduced, and different technologies are selected automatically for the RL processing facilities. The results demonstrate that the return yield increases significantly with the greener technology selections. The study also draws significant implications, specifically that carbon tax regulatory policies aid in significantly reducing carbon emissions to a large extent along with increasing product return yield. Hence, the results will help industrial managers in their strategic and tactical decision making. Their evaluations of recovery options, technology selection, and vehicle selection with regard to economic and ecological impact will permit decision makers to gain valuable managerial insights. © 2023 The Authors",Carbon tax policy; Eco-efficiency; Multi objective; Network design; Reverse logistics,Carbon; Computer system recovery; Economic and social effects; Electronic Waste; Environmental impact; Goal programming; Integer programming; Product design; Recycling; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Carbon tax policy; Carbon taxes; Eco-efficiency; Green technology; Multi objective; Network design; Reverse logistics; Reverse logistics network design; Tax policies; Decision making,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147845364

Three counteractive strategies are proposed: introducing virtual showrooms, offering a full-refund return policy and offering an exchange policy. Accordingly, duopoly competitive models are constructed to examine the roles of these strategies in mitigating product match uncertainty. In addition, the interaction among these three counteractive strategies is also explored. Results show that: these three strategies have positive effects on the platform's demands but adverse effects on BM store's. Both the full-refund return policy and the exchange policy can benefit the platform, especially the exchange policy. Nevertheless, whether introducing virtual showrooms can benefit the platform mainly relies on the establishing cost. In most cases, it is more advisable for the platform to offer an exchange policy rather than a full-refund return policy. Generally, introducing virtual showrooms and offering a return policy (an exchange policy) are two complementary methods, but the refund return policy can be seen as a replaceable measure for the exchange policy. In extensions, we explore the impacts of endogenous signal accuracy, managerial optimism and the partial-refund return policy. Several findings are also achieved: it is always beneficial to establish virtual showrooms if the platform can endogenously determine the accuracy of the information disclosed by the virtual showroom. Compared with managerial pessimism, managerial optimism generates more profits for the platform. A generous return policy leads to a higher selling price and greater profits for the platform. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Exchange policy; Full-refund return policy; Product match uncertainty; Showrooming; Virtual showroom,Competition; Sales; Adverse effect; Competitive models; Duopoly markets; Exchange policy; Full-refund return policy; Product match uncertainty; Return policy; Showrooming; Uncertainty; Virtual showroom; Profitability,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145250285

Specifically, the findings demonstrate that low reputation e-seller is more likely to offer RI. Moreover, when the sellers are more divergent, they are more likely to co-exist in the market.

Interestingly, while few studies suggest that engaging in unplanned purchase actions (i.e. impulsive buying) is not always associated with negative emotions among customers (i.e. postpurchase cognitive dissonance), others suggest that impulsive buying is directly associated with cognitive dissonance. This paper aims to investigate and understand the key antecedents of online impulsive buying among Moroccan Gen Z consumers, and how it contributes to postpurchase dissonance. The authors also try to gain deeper insights by investigating the disparities between males and females using mutigroup analysis. Design/methodology/approach: Based on data collected from 333 Moroccan Gen Zers, the hypothesized model was empirically tested using a partial least squares estimation. Findings: First, the results confirm that impulsive buying is positively associated with postpurchase dissonance. Second, while hedonic shopping motivation, fear of missing out and materialism were found to significantly impact online impulsive buying, price value and online reviews had no significant effect on online impulsive purchases. The importance–performance matrix also suggests that the fear of missing out is the most important factor leading to online impulsive buying, followed by hedonic shopping motivation and materialism. Finally, the results confirm that female shoppers are more likely to engage in impulsive buying behavior, and this was mainly due to higher fear of missing out, hedonic shopping motivation and materialism. Practical implications: First, the study findings can help online merchants to construct well-designed online shopping platforms and effective e-marketing tactics to stimulate purchase intentions among Gen Z shoppers. Online merchants should also attempt to reduce the negative feelings associated with unplanned buying behavior by introducing additional incentives, effective consumer interactivity and flexible return policies. This would help online suppliers in retaining customers and transforming impulse purchases into more recurrent ones. Second, online retailers should take into consideration the differences between male and female consumers by appealing to the role of gender in purchase situations when marketing their products and services. Finally, the findings offer interesting implications to society by allowing online shoppers to make well-informed purchase decisions without being influenced by personal and products’ traits. Originality/value: While prior research assessed the investigated constructs in separate models, the study suggests an integrated framework that incorporates different determinants of online impulsive shopping as well as its impact on postpurchase cognitive dissonance. Additionally, the authors explored the moderating effect of gender to gain deeper insights with regard to the disparities between males and females while engaging in online impulsive buying.

Reverse logistics and return policies are receiving more attention due to increasing consumer concerns and corporate responsibility toward the environment. Hence, this article presents a sustainable supply chain model for waste reduction incorporating reverse logistics operations. A suitable return policy is discussed here for deteriorating items, incorporating an eco-design framework. Since carbon emissions are a major environmental issue, a penalty tax for polluting is introduced to reduce carbon emissions. This model considers the cost of carbon emissions due to transportation, storage, production, landfilling, building construction, power supply, and loading/unloading. Unlike previous studies, this study investigates and compares three optimization techniques based on cooperative and non-cooperative associations. The mathematical formulation has been provided with different lemmas, theorems, and algorithms. By investigating end-of-life policies, it is shown that reused products can result in more profits for a company. A product usually becomes useless and non-recoverable after four uses. However, the product's reusability can be increased by investing more in the design stage of the item. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Centralized decision making; Deterioration; Eco-design; Reverse logistics; Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium; Waste reduction,Carbon; Computation theory; Decision making; Ecodesign; Game theory; Product design; Reusability; Supply chains; Carbon emissions; Centralised; Centralized decision making; Closed-loop; Corporate responsibility; Logistics model; Return policy; Reverse logistics; Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium; Waste reduction; Deterioration,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146290796

Common safety requirements such as collision avoidance are only state-dependent, which can be restrictive for complex missions. In this work, we address a more general formulation as safe-return constraints, which require the existence of a return-policy to drive the system back to a set of safe states with high probability. The robot motion is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with probabilistic labels, which can be highly non-ergodic. The robotic task is specified as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas over these labels, such as surveillance and transportation. We first provide theoretical guarantees on the re-formulation of such safe-return constraints, and a baseline solution based on computing two complete product automata. Furthermore, to tackle the computational complexity, we propose a hierarchical planning algorithm that combines the feature-based symbolic and temporal abstraction with constrained optimization. It synthesizes simultaneously two dependent motion policies: the outbound policy minimizes the overall cost of satisfying the task with a high probability, while the return policy ensures the safe-return constraints. The problem formulation is versatile regarding the robot model, task specifications and safety constraints. The proposed hierarchical algorithm is more efficient and can solve much larger problems than the baseline solution, with only a slight loss of optimality. Numerical validations include simulations and hardware experiments of a search-and-rescue mission and a planetary exploration mission over various system sizes.

It is profitable for the manufacturer to offer a flexible returns policy when there is retail competition than under monopolistic condition. Practical implications: Practitioners view returns policy offered as an insurance given to the buyers and they infer it to be a better mechanism for doing business. Lenient returns policy promotes the sales by increasing the trust on the retailer and boosts up the perception of quality about the product by lowering the perceived risk for customers. Originality/value: Effective product return strategies such as being lenient in terms of time, money, effort, scope and exchange can result in increased revenues, lower cost and improved profitability to the manufacturer and retailer, at the same time offering an enhanced level of customer service. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Game theory; Manufacturer's flexible returns policy; Price and effort sensitive demand; Retail competition; Retailer's lenient returns policy; Supply chain management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126038490

Although returning products influences consumer satisfaction, most studies have studied product returns from economic and logistical perspectives and a smaller number of studies addressing the psychological impact of returning products can be found. This study fills the void in the literature on apparel product returns and offers retailers insight into how negative feelings related to product returns are connected to their future purchase intentions from the retailer. In addition, the influence of the recreational shopper characteristic is studied within the context of product returns. Hypotheses were tested that examine the relationship among variable product return effort, recreational shopper identity, product dissonance, and purchase intentions. Data from 227 female participants recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) were analyzed. Findings support the hypothesized influence of product return effort and recreational shopper identity on product dissonance.

This paper aims to seek the optimal online channel modes for the two members in a platform supply chain in the presence of product returns. Design/methodology/approach: This study aims to develop a platform supply chain that consists of one platform company and one supplier. Along with an offline distribution channel, the supplier can choose two alternative online selling modes (i.e. the reselling and agency modes) to sell its product through the online marketplace. This paper applies Stackelberg game to derive the equilibrium with different business scenarios and selects the optimal online channel modes for two parties, respectively. Moreover, this paper extends to a different supply chain with a reverse channel leadership and a different product return policy for testing the robustness. Findings: Several interesting and important results are derived in this paper. Firstly, it is found that the relative pricing are largely relied on the costs of two channels. Secondly, the platform supply chain may benefit from a pure channel rather than the dual-channel when this channel enjoys a relatively low cost and/or a sufficiently high consumer preference. Then, the platform and the supplier act contradictorily when selecting their optimal online channel modes. To be specific, the platform motivates to choose the online reselling mode when both the commission rate and the slotting fee are relatively low, whereas the supplier is likely to select the online agency mode under this circumstance. Finally, a win-win situation in regards to the optimal online channel mode for two parties is achievable with numerical experiments. Practical implications: Based on the analytical studies, the results derived in the authors’ work can provide managerial insights to assist the supplier and the platform company in determining the operational decision and selecting the optimal online channel mode to deal with consumer returns. In addition, appropriate commission rate along with slotting fee will make both parties achieve a win-win situation in determining their optimal online channel mode. Originality/value: To the authors’ best knowledge, this paper makes the first move to determine the optimal online channel mode in the content of consumer returns and study how it is affected by different product return policies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Dual-channel; Game theroy; Online channel mode; Supply chain management,Costs; Electronic commerce; Sales; Dual channel; Game theroy; Mode selection; On-line Selling; Online channel mode; Online channels; Product returns; Real-world practice; Return policy; Win-win; Supply chain management,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148353568

Despite the fact that the issue of uncertainty in e-commerce has been extensively discussed, little is known about the mechanisms that customers of social commerce employ to lessen their perceptions of uncertainty. The role of various factors, including return policy leniency, information quality, seller popularity, seller reputation, and number of positive comments, in product uncertainty in social commerce is still little understood. Additionally, the social commerce literature indicates that more research is required on the mediating role of seller uncertainty. According to the empirical evidence from 471 customers, return policy leniency, information quality, seller popularity, seller reputation, and number of positive review comments all have significant negative effects on seller uncertainty. In addition, the results demonstrate that seller uncertainty partially mediates the relationships between these factors and customers’ perceptions of product uncertainty in social commerce. These findings reveal important implications for both practice and theory. © 2023 The Author(s)",Information quality; Product uncertainty; Seller popularity; Seller reputation; Seller uncertainty; Social commerce,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150898784

Besides the monetary costs, they lead to increased transportation, packaging and processing, and the returned items are often discarded. We present strategies and practices retailers can adopt to manage their product returns in a way that reduces environmental impacts. With eCommerce flourishing, product returns have increased significantly. Whilst highest for online sales, they are a challenge across all channels. The importance of developing sustainability management in operations and supply chains is evident from the growing body of literature, but there is a gap regarding the management of product returns in a more environmentally sustainable manner. To address this gap, we interviewed multichannel retailers, retail experts and return service providers operating in the UK and North America. The findings reveal that although retailers have started paying attention to the financial impact of returns, there is little awareness of the scale of environmental impacts. In addition, retailers lack a comprehensive approach to addressing the environmental impact of product returns. Based on our findings, we (1) unpack the barriers inhibiting retailers from developing environmental sustainability plans in returns management, (2) present a set of strategies for retailers to reduce the environmental impact of returns and (3) develop a framework for environmental sustainability in returns management.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study using semi-structured in-depth interviews was conducted with 47 respondents. Their lived experiences across 50+ ITPS were studied. A grounded theory approach was used to develop a theory with reference to consumer adoption of ITPS. Findings: Themes emerged across the adoption process, such as triggers for adoption (pressing need, making life more pleasurable, urge to acquire and forced initiation); hesitancies faced by consumers during evaluation (value alignment, utilization, ecosystem, risks with new technology and price); and factors that help in overcoming the hesitancies (word of mouth, de-risking schemes and self-devised strategies). Practical implications: Innovators must understand customer triggers and design offerings that activate the same – addressing a pressing need or making lives more pleasurable. Users driven purely by an urge to acquire can be a source of early word of mouth for radical innovations. Innovations must be designed and communicated to minimize hesitancies. Mitigating schemes such as equated monthly installment and return policy can be offered to empower customers to overcome hesitancies.

Reversely, the specification upgrading decision for used parts/modules is also affected by the original specifications selected for parts/modules during the new product design process. Hence, the joint optimisation of PDC for both new and remanufactured products entails a hierarchical decision framework, of which scarcely any study involves the specification upgrading concerns. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a bilevel optimisation model that involves two-level decision-making. The upper level handles the configuration of new product variants to maximise the shared surplus of new product offerings. Meanwhile, the lower-level deals with the configuration and specification upgrading of remanufactured product variants to maximise the shared surplus of remanufactured product offerings. A non-linear integer bilevel programming is further presented to model the hierarchical optimisation problem, to solve which a nested bilevel genetic algorithm is also proposed. Furthermore, a case study involving configuration design for new and remanufactured mobile phone variants is conducted to validate the proposed model. Four scenarios are investigated to examine the effects of model parameters on the optimal solutions with the simulation result given at last. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bilevel optimisation; Nested bilevel GA; Product design configuration; Remanufactured product; Specification upgrading,Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Specifications; Bi-level optimization; Bi-level optimization models; Bilevel; Design configurations; Joint optimization; Nested bilevel GA; Product design configuration; Remanufactured products; Specification upgrading; Used product; Product design,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160862637

A scenario-based online survey was conducted. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Push factors (consumer dissatisfaction) and a mooring factor (mail return habit) only manifested weak effects on switching intention. Regarding pull factors (service convenience and green value), in contrast to previous research, the effect of green value on switching intention was found to be much weaker than the effect of service convenience. Convenience was found to be the key factor in green communication. Our research adds value to green communication and the PPM framework. It updates existing knowledge concerning the role of consumer dissatisfaction, perceived green value, and perceived convenience of return service in green communication.

More and more consumers tend to bracket, which means they purchase multiple versions of the same product to try at home and return those that do not meet their requirements. This bracketing behaviour can increase the likelihood that consumers buy the good-fit products. However, the tsunami of returns from bracketing has become challenging for online retailers. In this paper, we analytically address this issue by developing profit-maximising models for retailers facing bracketing customers. Our contribution is to explore whether and under what conditions should retailers encourage or discourage the bracketing purchase behaviour. Whether or not bracketing is profitable for retailers depends on the bracketer proportion and retailer’s reverse logistics cost. Further, we also find that while the profit is eroded because of the large number of returns, retailers should order more product to meet bracketers’ demand. In addition, we generate managerial insights from the findings that help online apparel retailers convert the seemingly harmful consumer returns from bracketing into an advantage. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Bracketing purchase; consumer behaviour; ordering strategy; product return; retailing strategy,Consumer behavior; Electronic commerce; Facings; Profitability; Apparel products; Bracketing purchase; Condition; E- commerces; Logistic costs; Ordering strategy; Product returns; Retailing strategy; Reverse logistics; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131544318

Before making a purchase decision, consumers learn about the product from many sources which helps them infer whether a product meets their preferences, i.e., social learning. Social learning constitutes a positive or a negative signal about the product resulting in positive-type consumers and negative-type consumers. Also, many retailers offer money-back guarantees (MBGs) to reduce consumers’ mismatch risk. We analyze a retailer's pricing and return policy decisions in the presence of social learning. Under both no returns and MBG, we find that when signal accuracy is low, it is optimal for the retailer to sell to both positive and negative-type consumers. When signal accuracy is high, it is optimal for the retailer to sell to only positive-type consumers. In addition, if no returns are allowed, social learning hurts the retailer when signal accuracy is low while social learning benefits the retailer when signal accuracy is high. If a MBG is offered, social learning always benefits the retailer. When consumers are heterogeneous in their belief about signal accuracy, if no returns are allowed, social learning benefits the retailer for a small match probability, whereas social learning hurts the retailer for a large match probability. Similar to the case of homogenous consumers, social learning benefits the retailer in almost the whole range of problem parameters if a MBG is offered. Moreover, we find that social learning can be a driving factor to the ubiquity of MBGs regardless of the heterogeneity of consumers. We also analyze the effects of quality effort investment, consumers’ full learning, consumers’ bounded rationality, and high salvage value on the retailer's pricing strategy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Pricing; Return policy; Social learning,article; consumer; human; investment; learning; money; probability; social learning; webshop,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150770203

In recent years, the business model of “weblebrity marketing” has been widely introduced by online brands to alleviate consumers′ uncertainty about product value. Weblebrities with influence and product selection skills are hired to promote and sell products to consumers in real time on livestreaming platforms. As proven, the collaboration between weblebrities and brands is a success and brings huge benefits. In the pre-sale on November 11, 2021, Li Jiaqi and Viya reached a cumulative trading value of RMB 10. 653 billion and 8. 552 billion, respectively. However, the prosperity of “weblebrity marketing” combines some things to watch out for. Compared with the previous sales model, “weblebrity marketing” is frequently accompanied by a higher return rate. China Consumer News reported an alarming return rate of 40% for some weblebrities. According to a report published by China Consumers Association in 2020, 60. 5% of respondents who refuse to buy through “weblebrity marketing” were concerned about the quality of products, and 44. 1% felt there was an extensive impulse purchase. When selling products, brands are not sure whether their products are of high or low value to consumers. After the production selection of weblebrities, brands enter into a partnership with them and have them convince consumers in the market that the products are of high value. Through observation, there are two types of consumers, namely rational consumers and impulsive consumers. Based on prior information about a product′s value and the weblebrity′s ability to select products, rational consumers perform Bayesian updates to get posterior information about the product and decide whether to buy it or not. Impulse consumers, by contrast, buy into the hype of weblebrities. For each transaction, the weblebrity is rewarded with a commission. After receiving the product, consumers decide whether to return it based on its true value. Where returns occur, they have to pay certain costs (e. g. hassle and mailing costs) before being refunded in full. The brand will receive the product, but will not ask the weblebrity to return the commission for the transaction. In spite of the academic concerns about “ weblebrity marketing”, scholars have mostly conducted research through qualitative rather than quantitative analysis. In view of this, this paper builds a mathematical model to address the following two questions: (1) How does the ability of weblebrities to select products affect the pricing and profitability of brands? (2) How does the proportion of impulsive consumers in the market affect the pricing and profitability of brands? In this paper, a Bayesian update model of consumers is established. Through the sales model of “weblebrity marketing”, brands sell their products to a market of rational and impulsive consumers. Watching the weblebrities′ judgment on the value of products, consumers are faced with the first decision-making, i. e., to buy or to give up. After the purchase, consumers decide whether to return or keep the product. Impulsive consumers completely trust weblebrities′ propaganda, while rational consumers make estimates of product value based on a priori information and weblebrities′ product selection ability. According to their behavior in the marketplace, consumers are classified into three types: (1) Type A, who keeps all the products they buy, regardless of their actual value; (2) Type B, who keeps the high-value products they buy and return the low-value ones; and (3) Type C, who returns all the products they buy. It goes in a sequence that: weblebrities announce the high value of products, rational and impulsive consumers enter the market and decide whether to buy the products, weblebrities make profits, rational and impulsive consumers decide whether to return the products, and brands make profits. This paper identifies how weblebrities′ product selection ability and impulse consumers′ proportion in the market affect brands′ profitability, especially brands should work with weblebrities with what selection ability and they should develop what pricing strategies in markets with different proportions of impulse consumers. Conclusions are: First, brands′ profits are non-monotonically correlated with weblebrities′ product selection ability at low proportions of impulse consumers; incrementally correlated with weblebrities′ product selection ability at high proportions of impulse consumers. Second, brands′ profits are decreasingly correlated with impulse consumers′ proportion at low selection ability of weblebrities; non-monotonically correlated with impulse consumers′ proportion at medium selection ability of weblebrities; and increasingly correlated with impulse consumers′ proportion at high selection ability of weblebrities. The findings have considerable implications for management: First, brands should minimize returns by reducing consumer uncertainty about product value rather than changing prices. Second, in the product sales model of “weblebrity marketing”, brands should attach importance to weblebrities′ product selection ability and impulse consumers′ proportion in the market. Specifically, markets with a small proportion of impulsive consumers are more beneficial to brands when the weblebrities they cooperate with are less able to select products. The more impulse consumers there are, the lower the price of products. Conversely, markets with a large proportion of impulsive consumers are more beneficial to brands when the selected weblebrities are good at selecting products. The more impulse consumers there are, the higher the price should be. Lastly, the higher the commission for weblebrities they cooperate with, the lower the price brands should set © 2023, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.",Bayesian update; Internet celebrity live delivery; Pricing; Return policy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159871935

This study used 302 data from Indonesian young adult respondents to examine the structural model, which was analyzed using the SmartPLS 3.2 software package. Findings: The results show that YouTube product reviews, product fit uncertainty and customer satisfaction are the key determinants of customers' product return intention. Furthermore, the results show that the credibility of YouTube product reviews has a major impact on customers' familiarity with a product, satisfaction and the likelihood of returning goods to sellers. Practical implications: In the e-commerce industry, increasing the use of YouTube product reviews will help businesses eliminate unnecessary product returns. Sellers are also encouraged to collaborate with YouTube producers to review specific products, which can benefit companies by raising brand awareness and gaining customer feedback. Furthermore, YouTube online product reviews can help consumers avoid having an unpleasant shopping experience that causes emotional reactions and lowers satisfaction.

A higher advertisement frequency increases costs but may increase the chances of acquiring new customers. Moreover, faced with a wide-ranging array of products that might fit specific needs, customers usually buy according to expectations about value and satisfaction. When customers are satisfied with a purchasing experience, they are more likely to buy again and share their experiences with others. Hence, companies are concerned about increasing customer value and service satisfaction to develop and manage customer relationships. This maintains a company’s competitive edge and can improve its market share. In this article, we incorporate the frequency of advertisements and the cost of customer relationship management (CRM) into the demand function under a product life cycle (PLC). Customers can return products in the appreciation period offered by a retailer. A profit-maximizing model is developed to analyze the joint marketing and ordering policy of each stage of a product’s life cycle with a product return guarantee. We construct an algorithm to identify the optimal decisions. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed model, and managerial insights are obtained from a sensitivity analysis, followed by conclusions and future research. © 2023 by the authors.",advertisement; appreciation period; inventory; marketing; return products,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151366889

A hybrid facility network is considered for cost-cutting and equipment sharing where the facilities of forward logistics are also equipped to provide reverse logistics services. The model considers the dynamic production and storage capacity of the facilities which can be expanded if required. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model is tested to deal with disruptions due to man-made or natural disasters. The dynamic facility allocation enables the model to withstand the demand/supply disruptions in a disaster-affected zone. Besides this, the model considers carbon emissions caused due to manufacturing, remanufacturing, repair, storage and transportation. These emissions are regulated using cap and trade policy Thus, the proposed model balances resilience and sustainability under uncertain market demand and product returns. The chance-constrained approach is used to obtain the deterministic equivalence of the stochastic demand and returns. The paper also investigates the changes in emission and production level in each country under demand and supply disruptions. The parameters of the model are mapped with the various dimensions of big data such as volume, velocity and variety.

To decrease the negative influence of online uncertainty, the largest Chinese e-commerce company, the Alibaba Group, invited an insurance company to develop return-freight insurance (RFI), a new kind of insurance, to compensate for consumers' losses in the event of online product returns. Complimentary RFI can increase consumer confidence in the retailer and attract more demand. Retailers who offer complimentary RFI demonstrate to consumers that their products and services are too good to incur excessive product returns. However, some low-quality online retailers can mimic competitors’ behavior by offering complimentary RFI to consumers. This study aims to introduce an innovative online return policy based on RFI and to explore whether low-quality online retailers would use complimentary RFI as their return strategy to mislead consumers. Using signaling theory, we built a conceptual economic model that includes three exogenous pricing variables: RFI, insurance premium, and compensation. These variables play different roles in the model because consumers cannot observe the insurance premium, but the compensation can be. The main finding of this study is that innovative complimentary RFI could be abused by low-type retailers when the premium and compensation are appropriate. Interestingly, compensation plays different roles for retailers with different product values: low-type retailers use complimentary RFI as a noise tool. When the product works for the consumer and the insurance profit is not too high, the compensation for the low-quality product should be larger than that for the high-quality product, which is different from conventional wisdom. Although high-type online retailers may use complimentary RFI as a product quality signal, there is still a significant risk that nefarious elements will use it to create product quality noise. © 2023 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.",Adverse selection; Noise/signal effect; Return policy; Return-freight insurance,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149467059

Keeping this in mind, this study deals with a sustainable closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) comprising an environmentally conscious manufacturer, a retailer, and a third-party collector (TPC) under the influence of government intervention. The manufacturer offers a return policy for the defective product up to a certain time, and the TPC offers an acquisition price to consumers for returning their used products. The government can offer no intervention or a tax-subsidy policy in the forward logistics, or a reward-penalty mechanism (RPM) in the reverse logistics, or both. Relying on different government policies, four models are developed first. After that, two collaborative models, viz. manufacturer-retailer collaboration and manufacturer-TPC collaboration, are developed for improving channel performance under the manufacturer-led Stackelberg gaming approach. Numerical results disclose that the government subsidy to consumers provides better functionality to channel individuals, consumers, and the environment. If the government considers imposing a tax, the RPM can help to improve channel execution marginally. A collaborative strategy between the manufacturer and the retailer under government taxation and RPM becomes the most efficient strategy for enhancing the triple bottom line of sustainability. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Closed-loop supply chain; collection rate of used products; product quality; reward-penalty mechanism (RPM); sustainability; tax-subsidy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137601177

Often, they use the store to fulfil online orders and to receive returned products. The uncertain product returns however complicate the replenishment decision of a retailer. The inventory also has to be rationed over the offline and online sales channels. We therefore integrate the rationing and ordering decisions of an omni-channel retailer in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that maximises the retailer's profit. Contrary to previous studies, we explicitly model multi-period sales-dependent returns, which is more realistic and leads to higher profit and service levels. With Value Iteration (VI) an exact solution can only be computed for relatively small-scale instances. For solving large-scale instances, we constructed a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. The different methods are compared in an extensive numerical study of small-scale instances to gain insights. The results show that the running time of VI increases exponentially in the problem size, while the running time of DRL is high but scales well. DRL has a low optimality gap but the performance drops when there is a higher level of uncertainty or if the profit trade-off between different actions is minimal. Our approach of modelling multi-period sales-dependent product returns outperforms other methods. Furthermore, based on large-scale instances, we find that increasing online returns lowers the profit and the service level in the offline channel. However, longer return windows do not influence the retailer's profit. © 2022 The Author(s)",Deep reinforcement learning; Inventory; Markov decision process; Online returns; Replenishment & rationing,Deep learning; E-learning; Economic and social effects; Iterative methods; Markov processes; Numerical methods; Reinforcement learning; Sales; Deep reinforcement learning; Inventory; Markov Decision Processes; Multi-period; Online return; Product returns; Reinforcement learnings; Replenishment & rationing; Service levels; Value iteration; Profitability,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137386838

However, not all customers choose to return the product when they are not satisfied. To improve the store's brand value and reputation, offering store-initiated returns (SIRs) is an innovative practice for retailers, especially warehouse stores. With SIRs, customers are notified by a store that they can return items for a refund regardless of their satisfaction status. Academic/practical relevance: In this study, we investigate how SIRs affect the quality decision and the supply chain partners’ profits and discuss how customers’ decisions affect the implementation. Methodology: We formulate the problem as an inventory model with a single store and a single supplier. Results: When the warehouse club has the power to utilize the SIR option, the supplier generally has a stronger incentive to supply items of higher quality. However, in some specific scenarios where customers are significantly more sensitive to product quality and with a higher product return rate, the supplier can adversely choose to supply products at a lower quality level to lower the cost. In terms of profit, we show that the warehouse club's profit is usually higher when the ability to initiate the SIR is available. In contrast, the supplier always earns a lower profit when the SIR option is available to the wholesale club. To reduce the reverse logistic cost, we also investigated the costs and benefits of utilizing a gift card option instead of a passive cash refund. We find that when the expected cost of the items purchased with the gift card is lower than the total loss from the SIR, a feasible cost-sharing scheme always exists such that both the supplier and the store benefit from the gift card option. Managerial implications: These results provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and issues that stores may face when implementing SIRs to improve customer satisfaction. It demonstrates the possibility of increasing product quantity and customer satisfaction with SIR strategy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Customer returns; Product quality; Retailing; Store-initiated returns,Cost effectiveness; Customer satisfaction; Quality control; Retail stores; Sales; Supply chains; Warehouses; Brand reputation; Brand values; Customer return; Customers' satisfaction; Problem definition; Products quality; Retailing; Return policy; Store-initiated return; Supply quality; Profitability,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85154033017

According to whether the product the retailer sells is noncompetitive or competitive, this study considers that there are cooperation and co-opetition strategies for the online manufacturer to realize an offline showroom partnership. In addition, the retailer would provide retail service for consumers who visit the store, while the service cost information is private. Thus, this study explores the optimal offline showroom partnership for an online manufacturer under information asymmetry. The results show that although partnering with a competitive retailer causes product competition, the online manufacturer would prefer the co-opetition strategy if (i) the competition intensity between the two products is low or (ii) the competition intensity is high and the cost to handle the returned product is low, and would prefer the cooperation strategy otherwise. Under the optimal strategy, the online manufacturer should design the contract according to the return handling cost. Nevertheless, the online manufacturer could set a higher price under the co-opetition strategy than that under the cooperation strategy. After comparing the online manufacturer’s optimal strategies and profits in different information environments, we find that product competition could reduce the online manufacturer’s profit loss caused by information asymmetry under certain conditions, and the online manufacturer with low return handling cost is more willing to adopt the co-opetition strategy under information asymmetry. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",contract design; information asymmetry; offline showroom partnership; product competition; Supply chain management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148294244

Moreover, extant literature is characterized by methodological paucity, which prevents a more diverse view on the problem of product returns. As a result, the authors enrich the literature by conducting a Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) experiment dealing with various product averting measures (including different types of measures with different levels of immediacy). Focusing on the most frequent online shopping segment (Generation Y) and the second most frequently occurring reason for product returns (i.e., consumers did not like the product), the authors exploratively evince that monetary/ utilitarian measures are preferred most and are effective, as well as funding of social and sustainability projects. However, substantial differences were detected based on consumers' green consumption values. Apart from that, the study contributes to the BWS literature by outlining the necessity to include anchor scaling and quality assessment criteria. © 2023 C.H.BECK oHG.

However, the interaction of streamers is easy to cause consumers’ impulse consumption, which leads to the soaring return rate. In this context, how to make reasonable return policies to avoid the loss is an important issue for brands. This paper studies return policy selection for brands. We mainly focus on MCN (multi-channel network) click farming and customer disappointment aversion in the situations that the return-freight insurances are paid by brands or consumers or brands and MCN jointly. Three leader-follower models with brands as leaders and platforms and MCN as followers are established. To solve the above bilevel models, we discuss the conditions under which the upper and lower models are both convex and, based on these theoretical results, we give the optimal strategies for all members. Then, through numerical experiments, we analyze the impacts of customer disappointment aversion level, MCN’s ability, commission rate, brand’s return-freight insurance purchasing ratio, and other factors on each member’s optimal decision. The results show that the return policy in the situation of return-freight insurance paid by brand is suitable for a market with the high level of customer disappointment aversion; the return policy in the situation of return-freight insurance paid by consumers is applicable to the case of low customer disappointment aversion and high commission rate; the return policy in the situation of return-freight insurance paid by brand and MCN jointly is suitable for the case of low MCN capability and can effectively restrain the click farming from MCN. © 2022 by the authors.",brand; click farming; disappointment aversion; leader-follower game; return policy selection,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144279076

Can the revelation of this information drive sales and profitability? We study the effect of disclosing product availability on market outcomes—product sales and returns—and identify the contexts where this effect is most powerful. Academic/practical relevance: Increasing sell-out is key for online retailers to remain profitable in the presence of thin margins and complex operations. We provide insights into how their information-disclosure policy—something they can tailor at virtually no cost—can contribute to this important objective. Methodology: We collaborate with an online retailer to procure a year of transaction data on 190,696 products that span 1,290 brands and 472,980 customers. To causally identify our results, we use a generalized difference-in-differences design with matching that exploits one policy of the firm: it discloses product availability only for the last five units. Results: The disclosure of low product availability increases hourly sales—they grow by 13.6%—but these products are more likely to be returned—product return rates increase by 17.0%. Because returns are costly, we also study net sales—product hourly sales minus hourly returns—which increase by 12.5% after the retailer reveals low availability. Managerial implications: The positive effects on sales and profitability amplify over wide assortments and when low-availability signals are abundantly visible and disclosed for deeply discounted products whose sales season is about to end. In addition, we propose a data-driven policy that exploits these results by using machine learning to prescribe the timing of disclosure of scarcity signals in order to boost sales without spiking returns.

This study explores the unique market of “smart solo shoppers”. Two empirical studies are conducted, which aim to identify the major dimensions of multi-channel shopping activities that are engaged by the shoppers (Study 1, n = 64) and to differentiate the shoppers' valuation of time invested in the distinct dimensions under different cultural influences (Study 2, n = 519). Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire is used for data collection, and data are analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: Results reveal that the shopping activities converge into four principal dimensions: offline shopping, online shopping, post-shopping delivery and product return activities. Shoppers who perceive offline shopping activities as a time burden and online shopping and delivery activities as venues of value creation are more strongly self-identified as smart solo shoppers. Furthermore, smart solo shoppers who are under a strong influence of individualistic culture are found to spend time on multi-channel shopping to make the right purchase the first time, whereas shoppers perceiving being in a weak individualistic culture prefer to engage online channels while being prepared to return the unwanted purchases. Originality/value: This study highlights an emerging research field in the nexus of solo consumption and smart shopping. Emphasizing the utility-driven and ego-expressive nature of smart solo shoppers, the authors provide an initial profile of these shoppers based on their time-valuation patterns and the contextual impacts of individualistic culture. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital shopping; Multi-channel shopping; Smart-shopper feeling; Solo shopping; Time valuation; Value co-creation,,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146999135

The research monitored three groups of variables – the importance of shopping decision factors, customer ID characteristics and PCRS characteristics. The authors explore relationships between these three groups of variables, and the authors tried to understand better the role of the PCRS system in customer perception of service quality. Design/methodology/approach: An electronic survey was used to collect data in the planned structure. Research questions were developed into variables, and these were then the basis for creating questionnaires. Data were collected through electronic questionnaires. The sample consisted of 327 respondents from Poland (confidence level = 95%, confidence interval = 5.42). Findings: The results of the research show that the PCRS is very important and appreciated from the customer's perspective. Most of the respondents are aware of their consumer rights and correctly understand the meaning of the term “pro-consumer refund system”. Respondents require complex service in terms of returns; their satisfaction does not depend on any individual factor. This also means that the return system must be lenient in each aspect. Originality/value: A detailed analysis of aspects of PCRS has not yet been carried out in the literature. Although previous studies have focused, at least in part, on defining the essential attributes of PCRS, in most cases, it was an organization-driven view of this topic. The research examined the interrelationships between aspects of PCRS based on empirical data and offered a new perspective on this evolving concept. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer behavior; Pro-consumer refund system; Product return; Refund policy,Sales; Surveys; Business to Consumer; Business-to-business; Customer expectation; Customer perceptions; Customer-service; Decision factors; Pro-consumer refund system; Product returns; Refund policies; System characteristics; Consumer behavior,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122442782

One current application is that providing supply chain transparency, sellers can disclose product information to consumers for authentication and certification. To examine the supply chain blockchain based transparency-level strategy and its interact with different refund policies, in a two-echelon supply chain, we consider a supplier decides on the transparency level and wholesale price, and a retailer decides on retail price and provides full refund (policy F), or partial refund (policy P), or no refund (policy N) policy to consumers. We find the refund policy choice and the transparency-level strategy have a mutual influence. A lenient refund policy (a higher refund) can generate more demand, which makes the supplier to provide a high transparency level, whereas a high consumer's transparency awareness also promotes the retailer to choose a more lenient refund policy. We find Pareto improvement exists under a cost-sharing strategy, and the retailer is willing to share part of the adoption cost only when the efficiency of improving the transparency level is moderate. Otherwise, the retailer adopts blockchain technology only when there is no cost sharing. Further, different shipping cost bearers can change the sensitivity of refund policy choice, and the supplier prefers to provide a high transparency level when the retailer covers the shipping cost. When the retailer becomes more socially responsible, the supplier is more willing to provide a higher transparency level, and the retailer is more willing to provide a partial refund policy. © 2023 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Constraint-based non-linear mathematical modeling was done for cost differential with and without crowdsourcing. This was analyzed against returns on investment for the installed infrastructure. Scenarios were looked into from the linear, iso-elastic and logarithmic demand functions to identify the optimal incentive policy. The results were further evaluated using “willingness to return” for customer willingness for product returns via drop boxes. Findings: Crowdsourcing is viable when product returns are no more than 15%–20% of the overall products, with a logistics cost differential of 15%–25%. These were only viable when the product return incentive was within the range of 15%–20% of the product cost, as well as the penalty was in the range of 25 to 40% for wrong returns.

The chapter outlines the recent v-commerce tools for interactive marketing in fashion metaverse. To enhance interactive marketing in terms of size and fitting in v-commerce, mobile 3D body scanning has a substantial influence on consumers. This empowers them to view fitting and size prior to any kind of purchase. This helps reduce the hassle of online product returns. In fashion metaverse, fashion buyers use mobile device for scanning to acquire personalised, highly detailed 3D body avatar and body dimensions along with interactive features of augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality. This provides rich visual information of product in fashion metaverse along with right size and fit viewing with sensory interaction. Consumers can experience in online shopping environment, realistic and engaging distinct features with enhanced functionality, interactivity, convenience, and time efficient. Moreover, the chapter concluded the practicability of v-commerce tools (mobile body scanners, VR, AR, and MR) with four main elements such as immersive technology, interactivity, attractiveness, and accuracy that have the potential to enhance the virtual interactive marketing. Further, v-commerce tools and metaverse environment have been evaluated with AIDA marketing framework to outline the effectiveness of interactive marketing strategy for consumers’ and retailers’ benefit. Thus, the v-commerce has a potential in benefiting retailers with mass customisation, virtual size recommendation, efficient inventory management, and designing of interactive marketing and retailing strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",3D Mobile application body scanner; Augmented Reality (AR); Fashion metaverse; Interactive marketing; Mixed Reality (MR); Virtual Commerce (v-commerce); Virtual Reality (VR),,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160152802

The key assumption underlying such debates is that EU states are essentially independent units, with their own admission and control challenges. We suggest, on the contrary, that migration control policies in Western European states should be considered as an interdependent, yet politically segmented, system. We test this view by analysing two migration policy fields widely different in terms of history and development, i.e., visa and return policy. With regard to visa policies, the systematic configuration emerges clearly. We show that, over time, the original Northern model of visa controls has become the widely accepted normative model across all European states today, formalised in the New Common Visa Code. Existing differences between North and South Europe have to be read in light of this generally homogenous background. On the contrary, policy harmonization and cooperation in return policies and practices have always remained low. We do not observe, however, evidence of a North-South cleavage. Interestingly, a process that we could define as “converge” is at play, since all EU states have shown to be largely ineffective in removing unauthorised TCNs from their territories. © 2023, The Author(s).",,,Book chapter,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85156157927

In Kenya, online customers have often been unwilling to shop online again, mainly because of delivery issues. However, the extent to which customers are satisfied with the last-mile delivery service remains unknown. This is despite the significant potential that the sector has, which remains unrealised in the country’s economy. Objectives: The key objective of this study was to establish the extent of customer satisfaction with the different elements of last-mile delivery service offered by online retailers in Kenya. Method: A quantitative approach was utilised. An online survey collected data from 467 online customers (‘users’ and ‘nonusers’) in Nairobi. The data were subjected to descriptive statistics and the mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the outcome of the study. Results: ‘Users’ were most satisfied with delivery options while ‘nonusers’ were most satisfied with delivery fees. However, both ‘users’ and ‘nonusers’ were least satisfied with returns. This study also found that ‘users’ were more satisfied with delivery options, delivery tracking and returns compared with ‘nonusers’. There was a significant difference in satisfaction with delivery options for ‘users’ and ‘nonusers’. Conclusion: Online retail managers are advised to improve the way in which they offer returns to their customers. This involves offering more options for returning the ordered goods, making it easy to locate the returns procedure on their websites and having a clear returns policy.

Women’s fashion is having a huge impact on the world stage as women are the most concerned about what they wear and also new attractive clothes are released regularly. Electronic word of mouth (EWOM) is considered to be an important source of information and helps potential customers in purchasing decision-making. This study attempts to gather in-depth information about the women’s apparel sector by mining these EWOMs. Topic modeling through latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is utilized here for extracting the key aspects about which the customers chat in their reviews that are posted online. A total of 23,486 reviews were accessed on which the LDA technique was applied after preprocessing the data for potential cleaning. LDA technique resulted in six topics, namely, aesthetic, functionality, expressive, performance, extrinsic, and return policy.

At the depot, a set of regular vehicles is available to deliver and/or pick up customers’ goods. A set of occasional drivers, each defined by their origin, destination, and flexibility, is also able to help serve the customers. The objective of VRPSPDOD is to minimize the total traveling cost of operating regular vehicles and total compensation paid to employed occasional drivers. We cast the problem into a mixed integer linear programming model and propose a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic with a mathematical programming-based construction heuristic to solve newly generated VRPSPDOD benchmark instances. The proposed SA incorporates a set of neighborhood operators specifically designed to address the existence of regular vehicles and occasional drivers. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed SA obtains comparable results with the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving VRPSPD benchmark instances – i.e., the special case of VRPSPDOD – and outperforms the off-the-shelf exact solver – i.e., CPLEX – in terms of solution quality and computational time for solving VRPSPDOD benchmark instances. Lastly, sensitivity analyses are presented to understand the impact of various OD parameters on the objective value of VRPSPDOD and to derive insightful managerial insights. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Occasional driver; Simulated Annealing; Simultaneous pickup and delivery; Vehicle routing problem,Benchmarking; Integer programming; Pickups; Sensitivity analysis; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Computational experiment; Construction heuristics; Mixed integer linear programming model; Neighborhood operators; Occasional driver; Origin destination; Pickup and delivery; Product returns; Simultaneous pickup and deliveries; Vehicle Routing Problems; Simulated annealing,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141340913

There are dozens of utility businesses in Australia but only four were listed on the Australian Stock Exchange — two regulated and two merchant. Over the past decade the Australian Energy Regulator entered a ‘tightening phase’ vis-à-vis Opex and Capex allowances, with regulated utilities arguing regulated rates of return were sub-optimal. In this article, earnings, dividends and market valuations of Australia's ASX-listed regulated and merchant utilities are analysed over the period 2007–2021. The practical evidence is Australia's regulated utilities avoided the large swings in earnings that characterised merchant utilities, exhibiting outcomes consistent with the lifecycle theory of dividend policy (i.e. falling cost of capital). Soaring valuations culminated in the simultaneous takeover events of Australia's two ASX-listed regulated utilities. This makes criticisms of regulatory policy on rates of return hard to reconcile, at least from an historic perspective. However, the industry now faces a very different trajectory and set of market conditions — rising rates, higher inflation and an unwinding of lifecycle theory effects given substantial network investments required to meet climate change objectives. This may in turn require returns policy recalibration. Unfortunately for policymakers, all regulated utilities have now been delisted, ending our ability to observe ‘real’ capital market responses to regulatory change. © 2023 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland",Dividend policy; Electricity; Regulated utilities,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145865938

This paper examines the post-purchase cognitive states that influence product return and the drivers that cause cognitive dissonance. Design/Methodology/Approach: A total of 208 valid responses were collected and analysed using SPSS v.22 and SmartPLS 3.2.8 software. Research findings: The findings indicate that emotional dissonance and product dissonance were the main contributing factors determining product return frequency. Switching barriers, customer opportunism and customer attitude significantly affected the level of dissonance; the consideration of liberal return policies and customer expectations of product did not. Findings support the mediating hypothesis of emotional dissonance, and show that product dissonance significantly affects emotional dissonance. Importantly, emotional dissonance has a larger impact on product return frequency than product dissonance. Theoretical implications: This study expands upon the existing literature by providing valuable insight into understanding the external and internal factors contributing to cognitive dissonance and product return frequency. Importantly, the study contributes to the conceptualisation of the mediating role of emotional dissonance in consumer behaviour, particularly in the retail context. Practitioner/Policy implications: The findings are useful in assisting grocery marketers in designing and implementing effective customer retention strategies and loyalty programmes. Pairing of right perceptions about product quality, quantity and volume with cost would be effective to reduce emotional dissonance, and retailers could highlight exclusive product offerings to reduce product dissonance. Research limitation/Implication: Future studies could take into account the influences of demographic variables and various communication platforms which might cause differences in consumers’ product return behaviours. This study only presents the findings of a cross-sectional study. A longitudinal study could be conducted to compare consumers’ product return patterns and cognitive dissonance over a longer time frame. © 2022, Faculty of Business and Economics,University of Malaya.

Once receiving a consumer's order, the arbitrage firm creates an order at the designer firm with a fake account and the consumer's shipping information. In this process, the designer firms fulfill all the purchase orders, and the arbitrage firm earns a profit without even touching the product. While the designer firm can enjoy a market expansion benefit, it also suffers from a high volume of product returns as some consumers eventually learn the true product price (from the receipt) and return the product they ordered from the arbitrage firm. We analyze the online arbitrage practice with a game-theoretic model and show how the entry of an arbitrage firm can hurt the designer firm's profit. In the current practice, many designer firms cope with this issue by simply adjusting the price, but we show that such a strategy does not necessarily alleviate the problem. We propose a different strategy: the designer firm adjusts its refund policy to curb the greedy behavior of the arbitrage firm. We show that the proposed strategy leads the arbitrage firm to decrease its retail price, resulting in a smaller number of returns and higher profit for the designer firm. © 2023 The Authors.

With a mixed method research design and studies in eight phases, the authors propose a comprehensive measurement instrument that incorporates a schema- and categorization-based theoretical conceptualization of how customers assess omnichannel retail experiences; they also integrate means–end chain theory to explain perceived omnichannel customer experience (OCX) as a construct. This construct captures multiple omnichannel evaluation dimensions: social communications, value, personalization, customer service, consistency of both product availability and prices across channels, information safety, delivery, product returns, and loyalty programs. Multiple applications of the measurement model empirically confirm the suitability of this instrument in consumer goods omnichannel retail settings. Its 36 items reflect nine first-order quality dimensions that combine to form the overall, second-order OCX construct. The measurement instrument offers sound psychometric properties, as confirmed by several reliability and validity tests, and predicts customer behavior reliably across studies. Thus, the OCX measurement instrument offers utility for theory, management practice, and further research. © 2022",Customer experience measurement; Omnichannel retailing; Quality; Scale development,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127529848

Assuming the multi-dimensional and systemic character of the circular economy, this article provides a road map of 60R circular economy principles that can be adopted in any company to create a positive economic, environmental, and social impact. This set of circular economy principles allows the existing performance of companies within environmental regeneration to be assessed, and identifies possible improvements to business circularity. Identifying additional “R"" principles could lead to increased synergy or complementarity between them. These 60R circular economy principles are classified in four groups - reduce, reuse, recycle and reverse logistics. The proposed list of CE principles provides a useful framework for business managers to structure potential tasks and develop strategies for CE implementation and serve as a roadmap for researchers to extend existing research on CE principles. This study is based on the systematic literature review critically examining 148 articles and providing a comprehensive and profound overview of circular economy principles to be considered by business practitioners and entrepreneurs. Previously, CE principles are researched in environmental sciences, engineering, and energy. This article contributes to the existing knowledge gap and builds new knowledge on the discipline of business management, as publications in these fields are scarce.

We demonstrate how, when, and why cross-selling during the product returns process can reduce this loss in revenue. We find consumers more readily spend money refunded from product returns than unspent money. We theorize that this refund effect occurs because consumers psychologically realize the loss of money when purchasing products and earmark that money for spending. Thus, consumers feel a smaller psychological loss when spending refunded money than unspent money on a subsequent purchase. In six experiments, we find consumers spend refunded money more freely than unspent money, even more than windfall gains like lottery winnings, on products in similar and different product categories (e.g., groceries vs. apparel). However, the refund effect only holds when consumers do not expect to return products at the point of purchase and before refunded money is commingled with money in other accounts. Our findings identify a new fungibility violation due to mental accounting (i.e., a new source effect), and illustrate its value for generating, validating, and explaining revenue retention strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

These are platform entrepreneurs—individuals who establish micro-retail businesses on third-party platforms. While there are now millions of such entrepreneurs worldwide, there has been limited scholarly investigation regarding the role of Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LSCM) policies that they can adapt to benefit their small businesses. Because the success of such businesses is intricately driven by the reviews they receive, we deem it essential to investigate how such reviews may be related to their LSCM policies. We conduct an observational field study at one such small platform seller. By investigating items sold under varying merchandise return policies (MRPs), we seek to isolate the relationship between MRP, and the likelihood, positivity, and depth of the reviews left by shoppers. Based on the concept of contractuality, rooted in Sociometer Theory, our results reveal that a more lenient MRP may serve as a perk that may positively impact the customer's review writing. However, the relationship is not monotonic. Instead, there is evidence that the effect of extended MRP leniency on reviews tapers off beyond a certain point. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Online Retail; Referrals; Return Policy,,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85157975801

The retailer's demand rate for each period is dependent on the selling price, product quality, and refund price. The first period's product quality has an impact on the second period's demand rate. In the first period, returned products are remanufactured and sold through the retailer with the new products in the second period. The manufacturer is the leader of the Stackelberg game who declares wholesale price(s) and quality of the product to the retailer who follows the manufacturer's decision and sets his selling prices for two consecutive periods. The manufacturer implements two pricing policies: (I) sets the same wholesale price for both periods (II) sets different wholesale prices for two different periods. The present research's main aim is to find the optimal strategies for lower pricing and high-quality products. Under these circumstances, four different decision strategies between the manufacturer and the retailer are developed and compared these strategies analytically and numerically. The effects of different decision strategies on the optimal supply chain results are developed with a numerical example. An optimal solution for all four strategies is obtained using Mathematica 9. In addition, graphical analyses are developed to determine under what circumstances a particular decision strategy is dominant over others. Numerical analysis suggests that fast-acting strategies produce dominant results, but adopting strategies with advanced notice can produce higher quality products.  © The authors.

It is of practical interest to predict the return rate by experimental means before introducing a product to the market. In this paper, we propose to optimize accelerated reliability tests to achieve the goal within limited time. To describe the heterogeneity in the customers’ usage mode, a discrete random variable is employed to model the degradation rate in addition to the continuous stress variable. To further characterize the heterogeneity in the customers’ behavior, two models of product return are investigated: one assumes that customers return products once the degradation level reaches the minimum eligible return threshold and the other assumes that the threshold varies among different customers. Optimal reliability tests are planned under the large-sample assumption with two novel test schemes: global optimal planning and stress constrained planning. Insights regarding the optimal plans are gleaned to ameliorate the test planning procedure and verify the optimality. A real example from the battery industry is then presented along with the simulation study and sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the methods. We find that the randomness in return level results in different test plans. Furthermore, the constrained optimal plans offer more robustness to the compromise plans. © 2022 The Authors",Accelerated degradation test; Fisher information; Optimal design; Reliability; Warranty prediction,Degradation; Fisher information matrix; Forecasting; Product design; Reliability; Sensitivity analysis; Testing; Accelerated degradation tests; Accelerated reliability tests; Additional costs; Fisher information; Optimal design; Optimal plan; Product returns; Reliability testing; Warranty coverage; Warranty prediction; Sales,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130946962

One of the mandatory regulations imposed by the government is that of the carbon tax, which has been quite successful in limiting the amount of carbon emissions produced during various industrial activities. In addition, the idea of the exchange scheme allows customers to bring an old product, return it to the buyer, and receive a price reduction on the purchase of new goods. Also, buyer allows customers to purchase new products at a regular price without the need to go through an exchange scheme. An inspection method is used to ensure the quality of an old product obtained through the exchange plan. In this way, old items of useable quality are refurbished and sold under the refurnished category, while poor quality items are sold for trash value.

We provide a first insight into the asymmetric effects of international energy and agricultural commodity prices on fuel prices in Brazil, a country that supplies much of the ethanol that the world demands. Closing prices data for the years between 2015 and 2020 are considered under a multivariate nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) framework. Our findings suggest that prices for the reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending (RBOB) have had both short- and long-run asymmetric effects on domestic gasoline prices in Brazil, while surges in heating oil (HO) prices have led to declines in Brazilian ethanol prices. We also consider nonparametric causality tests, which support the findings towards a considerable influence of HO on Brazilian ethanol price returns. Policy and stakeholder implications are further discussed, along with avenues for future studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Asymmetric pass-through; Commodity markets; Ethanol; Gasoline; NARDL,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127941768

In this paper, we develop a model for optimizing the retailer's price, quantity, and terms of the product return policy in the presence of consumer opportunistic behavior (wardrobing). We consider a seasonal product and formulate and solve a newsvendor (e-tailer) model where an in-season price markdown may be used before any remaining inventory is salvaged at the end of the season. We compare a return policy in which refunds for returned products are in cash to one where refunds are in store credit or gift cards (SC/GC). Products sold at the clearance (salvage) price cannot be returned or exchanged. We find that with both cash and SC/GC refunds, consumer product match uncertainty, measured by the probability of the product matching consumers’ expectations, benefits consumers who keep the product more than consumers who return it. Moreover, under realistic conditions, using SC/GC refund increases the profits of the e-tailer and benefits consumers who keep the product by lowering the price. We also find that even when consumers redeem all SC/GC, using SC/GC refunds can still be beneficial to the retailer because SC/GC refunds deter proportionally more wardrobers from buying than consumers from buying. As a result, costly returns are reduced and the e-tailer benefits. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Pricing; Return policy; Store credit and gift card refund; Wardrobing,Consumer behavior; Consumer products; Costs; Electronic commerce; Sales; E-tailers; Newsvendors; Ordering quantity; Product matching; Product returns; Return policy; Seasonal product; Store credit and gift card refund; Uncertainty; Wardrobing; Salvaging,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147554413

However, a higher return rate than that of traditional e-commerce not only affects the consumption experience of users but also is detrimental to the development of the entire industry. Previous studies on product returns have mainly focused on traditional e-commerce, with few studies considering signals in unstructured data formats. The main contribution of our research is the design of a multimodal analytics framework to predict product returns in live streaming e-commerce settings. Multimodal features (e.g., visual, textual, and acoustic) and their correlations extracted from different data sources (product descriptions and live streaming records) are considered in our prediction model. In addition, to better study the impact of anchor speech during live streaming, we propose an acoustic feature extraction model called “OpenTransformer,” which extracts acoustic features of anchor audio and outperforms baselines. We have conducted experiments based on a real-world dataset collected from Taobao live streaming. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using multimodal signals from products and anchors for product return prediction. The managerial implications of our research are that live streaming platforms and potential consumers can prejudge which sold products will have high return rates in a timely fashion, and based on these predictions, merchants and anchors can better design their product descriptions and speech behaviors. This study thus supports more effective development of live streaming e-commerce markets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Audio analytics; Live streaming e-commerce; Multimodal analytics; Product return prediction,Anchors; Audio acoustics; Consumer behavior; Electronic commerce; Product design; Audio analytic; E- commerces; Live streaming; Live streaming e-commerce; Multi-modal; Multimodal analytic; Product descriptions; Product return prediction; Product returns; Unstructured data; Forecasting,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153362192

Home shopping networks adopt promotional tactics to pitch sales and even encourage consumers' impulse buying. Marketing and sales management often assume that home shoppers' impulse buying will increase sales and profits, not considering the possibility that a significant number of impulse purchases could be canceled or returned. In general, product shortages driven by consumers' impulse buying may create a phantom stockout condition whereas non-impulsive consumers are deprived of purchasing opportunities while products are in the process of being canceled or returned. This is the first large-scale empirical study that addresses the relationship between impulse buying and product shortages in a network retail context. Based on actual transaction data, a novel research plan is developed to measure the impact of consumers' impulse buying on the retailer's revenue and product shortages. The findings indicate that impulse buying may cause product shortages directly. We conduct a post hoc analysis to investigate the differences in the impact of impulse buying between newly introduced and existing products and between hedonic and utilitarian products. Based on the empirical findings, we provide managerial implications for home shopping network retailers. © 2023 The Authors.

The growth in old goods, as well as their negative environmental and social consequences, prompted supply chain operators to focus more on reverse logistics for collecting and reusing these items. However, there are a few key issues that should be handled in this manner, covering how to implement an effective collecting plan. What categories of used items should be collected? And how should they be handled for the aim of reusing them? To address these questions, the pricing issues are investigated in a CLSC with a manufacturer and two retailers. As an effective collection strategy, the first retailer, along with selling new products, benefits from the product exchange program (PEP). In this program, the retailer, by offering two types of discounts on a new product’s price, is able to collect two types of products, including those without and with useful lifetime left as the first- and second-category products, respectively. In terms of used products management, the first-category products are sent to the manufacturer for recycling, and the second-category ones are sold as second-hand products by the first retailer. Besides, the first retailer exercises a full refund return policy, where the returned defective products, after being remanufactured by the manufacturer, are sold to customers by the second retailer in the secondary market. With respect to buy back price of first-category products from the first retailer, two scenarios are considered: 1) the manufacturer pays as much as the difference between the original retail price and discounted retail price in order to encourage the retailer to offer exercise the PEP for returned used items, or 2) by considering the discount on wholesale price, the manufacturer pays as much as the difference between the original wholesale price and discounted wholesale price. In this study, a real-world case study is considered based on an Iranian automotive industry to understand the issue better and obtain practical results. The findings show that the second scenario is more profitable due to lower selling prices and greater demand rates. It is proved that the PEP along with providing environmental benefits can improve supply chain financial profit even for the first or the second-category products. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Closed-loop supply chain; Game theory, Iran; Pricing; Product exchange program; Return policy",Commerce; Consumer Behavior; Costs and Cost Analysis; Industry; Iran; Marketing; Iran; game theory; policy approach; price determination; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; supply chain management; commercial phenomena; consumer attitude; cost; industry; Iran; marketing,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137515305

We consider a retailer who sells a product through both online and in-store channels to customers who face uncertainty over product fit. We endogenize customers’ purchase and return decisions. Online customers may return misfit products online or to the store, depending on the retailer's return policy, whereas store customers inspect in store before purchase and will not need to return their products. We examine the impact of BORS on the retailer's store operations in terms of customer base, inventory decisions, and expected profits. We find that customers respond to BORS only when the return penalty and return rate are both relatively low. BORS can help the retailer attract new customers and also induce channel shifting among existing customers. After offering BORS, the retailer can stock less in-store inventory. We find that not all categories of product suit an in-store return policy. In particular, when the proportion of resalable returns is high, offering BORS will hurt the retailer's profitability. In addition, we find that introducing BORS does not necessarily increase cross-selling profits. We also analyze the impact of an exchange policy where customers can exchange misfit items for similar items in store. We find that an exchange policy can help the retailer retain more customers and attract more customers to the store, which will further benefit the retailer's profitability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Inventory management; Omnichannel return policy; Product fit uncertainty; Retail operations,article; profit; punishment; uncertainty,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151538359

Many studies have investigated the relative effect of straw return on SOC content, while the magnitude and efficiency of straw return in building up SOC stock remain uncertain. Here, we present an integrative synthesis of the magnitude and efficiency of SR-induced SOC changes, using a database comprising 327 observations at 115 sites globally. Straw return increased SOC by 3.68 ± 0.69 (95 % Confidence Interval, CI) Mg C ha−1, with a corresponding C efficiency of 20.51 ± 9.58 % (95 % CI), of which <30 % was contributed directly by straw-C input. The magnitude of SR-induced SOC changes increased (P < 0.05) with increasing straw-C input and experiment duration. However, the C efficiency decreased significantly (P < 0.01) with these two explanatory factors. No-tillage and crop rotation were found to enhance the SR-induced SOC increase, in both magnitude and efficiency. Straw return sequestrated larger amount of C in acidic and organic-rich soils than in alkaline and organic-poor soils. A machine learning random forest (RF) algorithm showed that the amount of straw-C input was the most important single factor governing the magnitude and efficiency of straw return. However, local agricultural managements and environmental conditions were together the dominant explanatory factors determining the spatial differences in SR-induced SOC stock changes. This entails that by optimizing agricultural managements in regions with favorable environmental conditions the farmer can accumulate more C with minor negative impacts. By clarifying the significance and relative importance of multiple local factors, our findings may aid the development of tailored region-specific straw return policies integrating the SOC increment and its environmental side costs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural management; Efficiency; Environmental condition; Magnitude; Soil organic carbon; Straw return,Environmental management; Forestry; Machine learning; Organic carbon; Soils; alkaline earth metal; magnesium; organic carbon; Agricultural management; Carbon A; Confidence interval; Environmental conditions; Global synthesis; In-buildings; Magnitude; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Straw return; agricultural management; efficiency measurement; environmental conditions; machine learning; organic carbon; soil carbon; straw; agricultural management; agricultural parameters; agricultural worker; Article; crop rotation; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental policy; machine learning; no tillage; random forest; soil chemistry; soil organic carbon; soil property; straw return; Efficiency,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149962307

One of the pathways to achieving 3BL in businesses is to create closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) covering the entire lifecycle of products. CLSC have proven to be important for sustainable supply chain (SC) operations, given the shortage of materials and labour globally following the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is widely acknowledged that the success of CLSC depends on successful collaboration between SC members, factors for successful CLSC collaboration are not sufficiently understood from the literature. Employing an observation-based case study and a survey of SC members, we develop our contribution in the context of an Indian packaging company, to delineate and verify a collaborative CLSC framework. The results confirm that the success of CLSC collaboration lies in the involvement and commitment of SC members. Collaboration for forward and reverse SC operations also facilitate the involvement of SC members in CLSC collaborations. Our research suggests that SC collaborations are enhanced by explicit incentive-sharing schemes and having the same SC members for both forward and reverse SC operations. © 2023 The Authors",Closed-loop supply chain; Collaboration; Covid-19; Product returns; Sustainable manufacturing,India; Life cycle; Closed-loop; Closed-loop supply chain; Collaboration; Covid-19; Packaging industry; Product returns; Reverse supply chains; Supply chain collaboration; Supply chain operation; Sustainable manufacturing; COVID-19; manufacturing; supply chain management; sustainability; Supply chains,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150484236

Using transaction-level data from a large retail chain in India, we document consumer strategies that leverage retailers to avoid costs associated with the country’s currency reform policy. We observe both an increase in returns of cash-purchased items that were bought before demonetization (strategic returns) and a spike in final (unreturned) cash purchases with soon-to-be-illegal notes (strategic purchases). Both practices serve consumer incentives either to receive legal notes from the retailer or to avoid depositing cash in formal bank accounts. Our analysis suggests that strategic consumers hindered the intended policy effect while partly benefiting the retail chain, leaving 20 million Indian rupees (INR) ($0.3 million) of demone-tized notes outside the formal tax network through this retail chain only; when we scale up the estimates to the country’s market size, the estimated total impact reaches 100 billion INR ($1.5 billion). Our findings offer implications for policy makers by quantifying a wide spill-over effect of government interventions that goes beyond the target group and document a new role of the retail industry: of absorbing and facilitating a response to macroshocks. © The Authors.",currency reform; policy evaluation; product returns; public policy; strategic consumer behavior; unintended consequences,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144182684

This study combined the common late-night shopping scene in the current market and the theory of ego-depletion. This study speculated that when consumers shopped during sleep-deprived time, they were more likely to make impulsive or unplanned actions due to lack of sufficient cognitive resources. Furthermore, this study postulated that purchase decisions were more likely to have regrets and return behaviors in the subsequent process. In addition, the moderating effect of two promotional cues (product price/discount ratio) was explored. The data comes from a large domestic e-commerce retail website. The data contains shopping behavior data at the individual consumer level from June 1 to July 31, 2021, with a sample size of 1, 625, 472. With minute-accurate purchase time information, we can distinguish between purchase orders generated during sleep-deprived and non-sleep-deprived periods. This paper used the Logit regression model to estimate the customer's return probability, and used the Cox risk model to analyze the relationship between sleep deprivation and return speed. Finally, the adjustment variables were added to the Logit regression model for verification. This paper derives several findings. First, it shows that sleep deprivation can significantly increase consumers' shopping regret behavior, which is manifested as increasing the probability of product returns and accelerating the speed of product returns. Second, this paper finds that product price positively moderates the effect of sleep deprivation on shopping regret, while the preferential ratio of promotional activities negatively moderate that effect. The findings help understand how sleep deprivation affects consumer behavior, i.e., consumers were more likely to experience shopping regrets (e.g., returns) after shopping during sleep-deprived periods compared to other times of the day, while promotional depth negatively moderates the effect of sleep deprivation on shopping regret. The results of the study suggest that consumers should try to minimize shopping during the period from 12:00 a.m. to 5:59 a.m. in the morning. If shopping during this period, they need to pay more attention to the central information of products and promotions. In the meanwhile, this study suggests that companies can consider adjusting the time of promotional activities from sleep deprivation periods to other periods, so as to reduce the increase in operating costs due to consumer shopping regrets and the increase in return rates. © 2023, Science Press.

Our objective is to study a retailer's optimal inventory control policy under product returns to maximize expected profit which is the sales revenue minus the procurement, backorder, holding, and salvage costs incurred in a finite horizon. We model a period's returns to be stochastically dependent on the previous period's sales quantity. Using dynamic programming formulation, we solve for the optimal periodic review inventory policy and provide structural results on the optimal policy of the final period. Through numerical studies, we show that incorporating detailed sales-dependent returns could increase a retailer's expected profit by 23%.

This study utilizes procedural justice theory (PJT) to conceptualize service recovery resilience as a capability that allows firms to meet customer requirements when dealing with disruptions, and empirically investigates its impact on procedural and interactional justice and customer outcomes (i.e. satisfaction and loyalty) in the context of product replacement. Design/methodology/approach: This research employs two scenario-based experiments using a sample of 368 customers to explore the outcomes associated with service recovery resilience. Findings: The investigation shows more satisfied and loyal customers when a retail supply chain can overcome service recovery challenges through SCR. The study shows that customers evaluate not only the process itself, but also their interactions with the retailer. Specifically, procedural justice and interactional justice have a significant influence on these relationships. Originality/value: This study proposes service recovery resilience as a concept that bridges service recovery theory with supply chain strategy in the unique context of product replacement. Further, this study also notes how information enhances customer satisfaction with the retailer's effort to address disturbances in the recovery process.

Some customers, however, abuse these lenient returns policies, which leads to fraudulent returns. In response, retailers take some strategic actions, such as increasing retail prices to offset the loss, or imposing restrictions on otherwise lenient returns policies. This paper argues that customers will have different fairness perceptions to retailers’ strategic actions, which can further influence their shopping behaviors. Our empirical results show that customers preferred more stringent returns policies to counter fraudulent returns and perceived restrictions to be fairer if used. Restrictions targeting perpetrators of fraudulent returns, either monetary or non-monetary, were perceived to be fairer than those applied to all customers. Our findings provide justification and support for retailers to strategically restrict product returns. Managerial insights from our study also help retailers identify effective instruments in the design of customer-friendly returns policies to reduce fraudulent returns. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Customer returns policies; Fairness perception; Fraud returns,article; fairness; fraud; human; offender; perception; shopping,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147221724

There are an increasing trend of product returns along with the growth of global e-commerce platforms, placing a huge significance on reverse logistics management. E-commerce being a competitive industry, factors such as environmental concerns, customer awareness, and legal pressure have led the firms to pay attention to the circular economy and sustainability concepts while managing their reverse logistics. Considering the above factors, this paper proposes a three-stage, circular reverse logistics framework for handling e-commerce returns. We introduce a novel method of applying ward-like hierarchical clustering with geographical constraints on returns data to identify return patterns as the first stage. As the second stage, a circular economy network was introduced among different parties to commit towards the circular economy. We develop a mixed integer linear programming model upon the above circular economy network in the third stage to capture different facets of the reverse logistics in e-commerce and optimize the network. At the final stage, the model is validated with a case study based on an e-commerce firm engaged in consumer electrical and electronics. The decision support system which is an output of this study will help the decision makers in e-commerce firms to embrace circular economy and optimize the reverse logistics network, while handling product returns. © 2022 The Authors",Circular economy network; Clustering; Decision support system; E-commerce; Reverse logistics network design,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136482891

Return freight insurance (RFI) is an emerging measure to resolve online shopping disputes with product returns. If a consumer returns an insured product, the insurance company will compensate the consumer for the return-freight fee. In practice, we observe that some dual-channel e-commerce retailers offer RFI to consumers, while others do not. We build consumer-utility-based analytical models to study the retailer's optimal pricing decisions and values of RFI. In the basic models, the proportions of store-type consumers and online-type consumers are exogenously given; we examine three cases, namely Case N (RFIs are not provided), Case R (retailer purchases RFI for consumers), and Case C (consumers pay for RFI). Comparing these three cases, we uncover that the retailer who purchases RFI for consumers does not necessarily charge a higher price. We show that if the RFI premium is sufficiently (moderately) low, it is more beneficial for consumers (the retailer) to pay for the RFI. We analytically prove that (i) when the product's salvage value is polarized or the return freight cost is low, using RFI can help increase consumer surplus (CS), (ii) when the salvage value is sufficiently high, the social welfare (SW) with RFI is higher than the case without RFI. In the extended models, we explore the situation in which consumers can decide whether to purchase RFI as well as the channel to buy the products. In this case, we find that (i) the retailer should provide RFI only when the product's cost, salvage value, and return freight cost are all high, and (ii) offering RFI can increase CS but hurt SW. We also consider various extended models to prove the robustness of the research findings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Dual-channel; e-commerce; Pricing; Return freight insurance; Supply chain management,Costs; Electronic commerce; Insurance; Sales; Consumer's surplus; Dual channel; E- commerces; Extended model; Freight costs; Insurance companies; Online shopping; Product returns; Return freight insurance; Social welfare; Supply chain management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141339346

As consumers do not differentiate among the channels where they try, purchase and/or take delivery of their product, they also expect maximum flexibility in the product returns process. On average, retailers forecasted returns to reach about 16.6% of the total merchandise that customers purchased in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation, which is an increase from an average return rate of 10.6% in 2020. The resulting cost of returns amounted to $761 billion worth of merchandise in 2021 (Repko in A more than $761 billion dilemma: retailers’ returns jump as online sales grow. https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/25/retailers-average-return-rate-jumps-to-16point6percent-as-online-sales-grow-.html. Accessed 17 June 2022, 2022). For retailers and manufacturers, integration of different reverse channels is extremely important to deliver the seamless experience demanded by today’s discerning consumer while ensuring the profitable handling of the returned products as well as ensuring the environmental sustainability of the retailing operations. Regardless of which channel receives a return, the reverse logistics network should have the flexibility and the capability to remarket or to recover the value in the returned product in a cost efficient and timely manner that maximizes firm profitability. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first studies that develops a linear programming model with profit maximization objective to help determine how to optimally decide the returned product touch point(s) in the reverse logistics network. Unlike the extant literature, our model explicitly incorporates the marginal value of time for returns, product characteristics as well as the underling reverse logistics network configuration in return channel selection strategy. We present a comprehensive analysis on how and to what extent the return channel selection is dependent on the product characteristics such as time-based value decay rate, defective rates, and disposal rates as well as the network structure. Using data from HP and Bosch Power tools operations as well as real geographical US data, we show that our decision model can effectively help determine the reverse logistics network and the type of facility where a product is returned as a function of product characteristics and economic parameters. Our work emphasizes that product returns and waste reduction, improved firm sustainability and profitability can co-exist through effective reverse logistics planning. © 2023, The Author(s).",Commercial returns; Reverse channel selection; Sustainability; Time-value,,Article,Article in press,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147737776

For example, when channel substitutability is high, accepting online purchased returns in the bricks-and-mortar store is likely to drive the in-store price up, despite a drop in the offline demand due to the cannibalization effect. In general, firms should allow cross-channel returns when channel substitutability is high, return handling cost is low, and self-channel returns are not hefty.

The design of a reverse logistics network is a major strategic problem in the field of reverse logistics. As cost pressures in product returns continue to mount, a growing number of manufacturers have begun to outsource reverse logistics operations to third-party logistics (3PL) providers. On the other hand, considering disruption risks caused by natural or man-made factors in the reverse logistics network design is inevitable. This paper studies third-party reverse logistics network designs under uncertain disruptions. The problem is formulated as a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming model with a mean risk objective. Two types of risk measures, value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR), were examined, respectively. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the model was carried out. The validity of the mean risk criteria is proved by comparison with risk-neutral approach. Moreover, the performance of the proposed model was examined by stochastic measures. © 2022 by the authors.",conditional value at risk; disruption; reverse logistics network design; risk management; third-party logistics; value at risk,economic impact; environmental issue; logistics; network design; risk assessment,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142679946

Companies in this industry find it a source of competitive advantage to invest in reverse logistics infrastructure. However, limited empirical studies investigate the enablers of the relationship quality between the retailers and their reverse logistics service providers. This study quantifies the impact of reverse logistics process coordination between retailers and logistics service providers on relationship quality. Moreover, it tests the mediating role of reverse logistics service quality and the moderating role of conflict frequency in this relationship. Data were collected through a survey using a purposive sample of 241 retail store managers from the fashion retail industry of Pakistan. For this purpose, a self-administered questionnaire was developed using a five-point Likert Scale to gauge the responses. Conditional process analysis was used to evaluate the moderated mediation model. The findings showed a significant positive impact of reverse logistics process coordination on the relationship quality with a logistics service provider, a significant positive mediation effect of reverse logistics service quality, and a significant moderation effect of conflict frequency on the indirect relationship. However, conflict frequency, contrary to the hypothesis in the study, strengthened the indirect relationship. Furthermore, the moderation effect of conflict frequency on the direct relationship was insignificant. This study will help managers better understand the best practices leading to effective management of reverse logistics processes, particularly product returns. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Conflict frequency; Fashion industry; Multichannel retailing; Process coordination; Relationship quality; Reverse logistics,Pakistan; conflict management; empirical analysis; infrastructure; retailing; service quality; service sector,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152898777

Traditional trade credit agreements, wherein a supplier extends a short-term loan to a retailer, can lead to over-ordering by the retailer even though she is financially constrained (FC), and this can affect supply chain efficiency. With ever-increasing product-handling costs, such over-ordering can have a severe impact on the supply chain profit. Motivated by our work with an industry partner, we design a game-theoretic model to evaluate optimal stocking decisions and wholesale prices in an FC supply chain, analyze the traditional trade credit model, and establish the reasons for over-ordering by the retailer when trade credit is deployed. We then examine how product returns, prevalent in the industry, can be used to control over-ordering. We design three different mechanisms incorporating returns in a trade credit model: quantity-limit-based returns, partial refund based returns, and marginal refund based returns. We find that returns-based policies improve profits for all members of the supply chain by driving inventory reduction and reducing over-ordering when trade credit is used. We also perform numerical analysis to quantify the impact of key parameters on the optimal decision variables. Our paper contributes by suggesting easy-to-implement mechanisms for improving trade credit deployment in supply chains and provides useful insights to decision makers to incorporate returns in trade credit policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Financially constrained; Inventory; Newsvendor; Over-ordering; Trade credit,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Game theory; Profitability; Sales; Credit model; Financially constrained; Inventory; Newsvendors; Order problems; Over-ordering; Return policy; Short-term loans; Supply chain efficiency; Trade credit; Supply chains,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146683799

Conflicting interests and expectations of these actors, as much as differing return policies, create unequal options and expectations of mobility. Migrant journeys, regardless the age, gender, legal status or social class, are always geopolitical journeys.

Increasingly, retailers are offering consumers a cohesive and comprehensive experience across digital and physical touchpoints by integrating online and offline channels. This study considers a competitive market structure with two retailers selling four products via both online and offline channels. The retailers act as the decision maker of both the product assortment strategy and pricing strategy. Consumers are heterogenous in their horizontal fitness regarding each product, while they are common in the return probability when facing a deceptive product. Consumers' purchase decision of whether to purchase through physical stores or online stores and making a purchase from which retailers depend on not only the product assortment strategies across competitive retailers but also the return cost that the consumers are faced with if product return happens. Results show that the online product return cost plays an important role in the retailers' optimal pricing strategy design and product assortment strategy design. To be specific, the optimal prices of products that are sold through the online channel first increase in the return cost of the online product and then decrease it; while the optimal prices of products sold offline are always increasing in the online product return cost. Moreover, no matter what placement strategy sellers will choose, the optimal profit of both sellers is first decreasing the return cost of the online product and then increasing it. Our analyses also depict a two-dimensional market structure by considering sellers' return costs and consumers' misfit costs to investigate the optimal selling strategies under the cross-channel shopping platform.  © 2022 Xin Huang and Shujun Guo.",,Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Product design; Market structures; Offline channel; Online channels; Online products; Pricing strategy; Product assortment; Product returns; Purchasing decisions; Selling strategies; Strategy designs; Sales,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141104058

Design/methodology/approach: In the first step, the different types of return policies of online shoppers and the risk-aversion level were determined by surveying 18 online shops and interviewing 21 customers. The risk-aversion level of these policies was found in the experts’ panel. In the second step, the experiences of 573 consumers when facing seller’s return messages, perceived risk and consumer trust in three countries (UAE, Iraq and Iran) were collected through a questionnaire. Finally, the gathered data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicated that risk-averse return policies taken by online vendors led to lower consumer trust. Moreover, customer perceived risk mediated the relationship between return policies’ risk-aversion level and trust in Iraq and Iran. At the same time, there was no significant association between return policies and perceived risk in UAE. In addition, perceived risk wholly mediated the relationship between return policies’ risk aversion and trust in vendors in Iran, but this role was minor in Iraq. Originality/value: Among the intercultural studies, especially in the Middle East, this is one of the first studies based on the marketing and sales management in an online shopper’s supply chain. Moreover, the investigation of return policies in online commerce is another innovative aspect of the present paper. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Behavior; Customer; E-Commerce; Online shopper; Risk,,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144142448

However, after buying the new product, the consumer who has traded in (the “trade-in consumer”) may return the new product and claim a refund for it if she/he is not satisfied with it. In this situation, under a full-trade-in-return (FTR) policy, trade-in consumers receive a generous refund that includes a trade-in-rebate for them to redeem if they purchase again in future. Alternatively, some firms have a partial-trade-in-return (PTR) policy under which trade-in consumers who return a newly purchased product only receive a refund for the amount of money they paid (without including the trade-in-rebate). In this study, we build stylized analytical models to explore the optimal choice of a trade-in-return policy. We find that there is no difference to the firm between an FTR and a PTR policy when no trade-in consumers keep unsatisfactory new products. In the case of a relatively medium residual value of the used product, FTR is always the better choice for the firm. When some trade-in consumers keep unsatisfactory new products, we show that FTR (PTR) is the better choice when the used product's durability is sufficiently low (high). We also show that the firm may not reduce its trade-in rebate when the “average new product satisfaction rate” of trade-in consumers increases. In the extended models, we find that, the firm is more likely to prefer PTR to FTR under the online–offline dual-channel retailing mode, but tends to prefer FTR to PTR when there is a competitive secondhand market, and should make the same optimal trade-in return policy when there are two selling periods. © 2021 Production and Operations Management Society",operations-marketing interface; pricing; retailing; trade-in-return policy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117075073

A mismatch of expectations and consumption experiences causes a stronger post-consumption dissonance for online purchases, the outcomes of which, in the form of emotions and coping responses, are under-researched. For this work, data were collected from 895 randomly selected respondents and the model was validated through structural equation modelling. The findings support that cognitive and affective components of post-consumption dissonance have a positive influence on negative emotions, a combination of anger, regret, and guilt. Such emotions are found to trigger coping responses of mental disengagement and seeking social support, but not product return. Additionally, the evoked negative emotions are found to be lower for the elderly and female consumers. Finally, it is found that individuals with maximization focus seek social support more than those with satisficing focus for coping.

This paper presents a review of the literature on the interaction between e-commerce and offline retailing, highlighting empirical findings and generalizable insights, and discussing their managerial implications. Our review includes studies published in more than 50 different academic journals spanning various disciplines from the inception of the internet to present. We organize our paper around three main research questions. First, what is the relationship between online and offline retail channels including competition and complementarity between online and offline sellers as well as online and offline channels of an omnichannel retailer? Under this question we also try to understand the impact of e-commerce on market structure and what factors impact the intensity of competition /complementarity. Second, what is the impact of e-commerce on consumer behavior? We specifically investigate how e-commerce has impacted consumer search, its implications for price dispersion, and user generated content. Third, how has e-commerce impacted retailers’ key managerial decisions? The key research questions under this heading include: (i) What is the impact of big data on retailing? (ii) What is the impact of digitization on retailer outcomes? (iii) What is the impact of e-commerce on sales concentration? (iv) What is the impact of e-commerce and platforms on pricing? And (v) How should retailers manage product returns across online and offline channels? Under each section, we also develop detailed recommendations for future research which we hope will inspire continued interest in this domain. © 2022",e-commerce; Offline; Online; Retailing,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124997012

Introducing product returns has led to the formation of closed loop supply chains, that is, situations in which organisations both manufacture and remanufacture their own products. Closed loop supply chains (CLSCs) have been known to be uncertain in the timing, quality and quantity of the returns. In addition to these uncertainties, most organisations lack the necessary infrastructure and technology to perform reverse logistics operations on their own. For this reason, they seek assistance from external parties such as third party reverse logistics providers. Third parties often have the expertise and technology required to run reverse logistics operations. At the same time, the rapid pace of e-commerce has led to manufacturers adopting more than one channels for selling their products. However, in a closed loop supply chain setting, the dual channel has been defined by more than just selling products both offline and online. The aim of this paper was to review literature on the use of multiple and dual channels in reverse logistics and closed loop supply chains and identifies research gaps as well as future research directions on the topic. The paper investigated how multiple and dual channels have been utilised to address issues in reverse logistics and closed loop supply chains. A content-based analysis was carried out for 57 papers. The identified characteristics of these papers were classified into 9 categories. By reviewing literature on dual channel supply chains, the paper was able to identify the ways in which different channels are formed in closed loop supply chains. The purpose of the paper was threefold. Firstly, the literature review described the general characteristics of dual channel closed loop supply chains based on what was revealed by existing literature. The review also classified literature based on the definition of dual channel CLSC, research methodology and topic of focus. Finally, the research proposed some meaningful gaps and directions for future research. The results of the review showed that there is need to expand literature on the competition of channels, greening strategies and carbon emissions and supply chain dynamics and stability in dual channel closed loop supply chains. Future research should also consider relaxing some assumptions and incorporating real case studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Circular economy; Closed-loop supply chains; Dual channels; Multi-channels; Reverse logistics,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112300477

We consider two competing dual-channel retailers, and investigate conditions under which it is optimal for one or both of the retailers to offer the BORS strategy. We first assume that a partial refund is offered for online returns and then consider the important case of a full refund. We show that whether both retailers adopt this strategy significantly depends on the return rate and cross-selling profit. Specifically, if the return rate is sufficiently low (high), at least one retailer (both retailers) will adopt this strategy when the unit cross-selling profit is relatively high. Nonetheless, both retailers will fall into the prisoner's dilemma under certain conditions. Interestingly, the return rate and proportion of consumers with a high hassle cost associated with BORS returns significantly influence the equilibrium channel strategy and the existence of the prisoner's dilemma. We further find that, when both retailers implement the BORS strategy, they both benefit from offering a full refund return policy when the number of online-type consumers is large enough and the unit cross-selling profit is relatively small, but should provide a partial refund otherwise. When only one retailer adopts the BORS strategy, a partial refund return policy is preferable. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Buy online and return to store; Competition; Cross-channel return strategy; Dual-channel retailer; Supply chain management,Commerce; Game theory; Sales; Supply chain management; Buy online and return to store; Competitive markets; Condition; Cross-channel return strategy; Cross-selling; Dual channel; Dual-channel retailer; Low-high; Prisoners' Dilemma; Return policy; Profitability,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121436072

In reverse logistics operations, capacity limits can lead to inefficiencies in the remanufacturing process. In this paper, comparisons were made of the Bullwhip effect (BWE) in closed-loop systems that have collection and remanufacturing capacity limits and those that do not. Collection and remanufacturing capacity limits were introduced for a system where a company had to collect ‘enough’ products before remanufacturing can begin. This introduced collection backlogs, remanufacturing backlogs and remanufacturing downtimes to the closed loop supply chain (CLSC). By adopting a systems dynamics approach, the research performed ‘what-if’ analyses of the closed-loop system under different levels of the factors under investigation. Two case studies were investigated: one remanufacturing electric vehicle batteries (low demand, slow moving item) and the other remanufacturing kitchen appliances (high demand, fast moving item). Firstly, introducing collection and remanufacturing capacity limits in the reverse chain increased the BWE to a level higher than the reverse chain without any capacity limits, but not to the level of the forward chain without any product returns. Secondly, introducing collection and remanufacturing capacity limits for a closed-loop system where a company had to collect ‘enough’ products before remanufacturing begins had different impacts depending on the product demand size and speed. The presence of external returns by other parties not regulated by an organisation had an impact of lowering the BWE in the closed-loop system and it also impacted how the other factors under investigation affected the Bullwhip effect.

Online retailers on such platforms can actively decide whether to provide WFS services for consumers. If WFS service is offered, a WFS logo will be displayed on the product information page by the platform. Although WFS can enhance consumers’ willingness to pay, it incurs cost for online retailers and may cause more product returns due to valuation bias. This paper investigates when an online retailer on a platform should offer customers WFS, and it explores the detailed effects of WFS on the retailer, platform, customers, and society. We find that both the retailer and platform do not necessarily benefit from WFS. Although the platform can take a “hands-off” attitude towards the retailer in most cases, they may have conflicting interests while providing WFS, so we have developed a mechanism to coordinate their benefits. Our results explain why the platform develops such a WFS service system, and when it should incentivize the online retailer to offer WFS to customers. Furthermore, WFS always hurts customers when the valuation bias is small, while it may favor the society when the WFS cost is low. In extensions, we verify the robustness of our results and also get new insights. First, a small product salvage value motivates the platform to encourage the retailer to offer WFS. Second, though a larger proportion of overestimating customers always benefits the platform, it may hurt the retailer when it is less than a threshold. Finally, a larger heterogeneity in valuation increment allows the retailer to charge higher price and benefits the platform. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Platform-based Worry-Free-Shopping; Valuation bias; Valuation increment; Value-added service; Willingness to pay,consumption behavior; retailing; shopping activity; valuation; willingness to pay,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139738714

It can not only reduce environmental pollution caused by straw burning, but also help to improve soil conditions. However, few studies focus on the impact of increasingly active land transfer on farmers' willingness to pay for straw return. This study had a theoretical framework for systematic analysis and based on data from 1080 households in Sichuan Province, China. The conditional value assessment method (CVM) was used to estimate the interval of farmers' willingness to pay for straw return, and IV-Probit and IV-Tobit models were constructed to control endogeneity and to explore the effects of land transfer on farmers' willingness to pay for straw return. The results showed that (1) only 37.69% of farmers were willing to pay for straw return, and the average amount of farmers' willingness to pay was 12.94–34.41 RMB/666.7 m2-season. (2) Land transfer, especially land transfer-in, increased farmers' willingness to pay and willingness to pay amount for straw return, but there were noticeable intergenerational differences and differences in land operation scale. (3) The perception of economic value and the perception of payment effectiveness play a positive mediating role. The conclusion provides reference for improving straw return policy and promoting agricultural cleaner sustainable production. It is suggested to encourage land contiguous circulation to promote land integration, and reduce the price of straw return. At the same time, farmers' correct cognition of straw return should be improved through extensive publicity, especially for the new generation and large-scale farmers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Agricultural cleaner production technology; Land transfer; Straw return; Willingness to pay,Economics; Pollution control; Agricultural cleaner production technology; Cleaner production; Environmental pollutions; Land transfer; Production technology; Soil conditions; Southwest China; Straw return; Theoretical framework; Willingness to pay; Agriculture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135856640

Return insurance is underwritten by an insurer and can be purchased by either a retailer or a consumer. Under such insurance, the insurer partially compensates consumers for their hassle costs associated with product return.We analyze the informational roles of return insurance when product quality is the retailer's private information, consumers infer quality from the retailer's price and insurance adoption, and the insurer strategically chooses insurance premiums. We show that return insurance can be an effective signal of high quality. When consumers have little confidence about high quality and expect a significant gap between high and low qualities, a high-quality retailer can be differentiated from a low-quality retailer solely through its adoption of return insurance. We confirm, both analytically and empirically with a data set consisting of more than 10,000 sellers on JD.com, that return insurance is more likely adopted by higher-quality sellers under information asymmetry. Furthermore, we find that the presence of the third party (i.e., the insurer) leads to double marginalization in signaling, which strengthens a signal's differentiating power and sometimes renders return insurance a preferred signal, in comparison with free return, whereby retailers directly compensate for consumers' return hassles. As an effective and costly signal of quality, return insurance may also improve consumer surplus and reduce product returns. Its profit advantage to the insurer is most pronounced under significant quality uncertainty. © 2021 INFORMS.",online retailing; return insurance; signaling quality,Sales; High quality; Insurance theory; Low qualities; Online retailing; Private information; Product returns; Products quality; Return insurance; Return policy; Signaling quality; Insurance,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129056856

The Chinese government has formulated a series of policies and measures and established some recycling pilot provinces. However, the intervention effects of different kinds of policies on pesticide packaging waste recycling by farmers’ and its mechanism were still unknown. This study took the pilot province Jiangsu Province as the example, by using the game theory and propensity score matching (PSM) model to analyze and compare the intervention effects of three kinds of pesticide packaging waste recycling policies, that is, punish, subsidy and reward, and mortgage return. The results showed that the three kinds of policies all positively affected farmers’ recycling behaviors in the pilot area. The incentive effect of the punishment policy was the weakest, and the mortgage return policy was prominent with the recycling probability increasing 44.8% under a single policy. Based on these results, some policy suggestions were put forward as follows: improving farmers’ cognition of environmental pollution caused by pesticide packaging waste and their awareness of environmental protection, establishing the necessary administrative punishment policy, increasing financial support and improving the standard of recycling subsidies, and vigorously promoting the mortgage return recovery policy in areas where conditions permit. So as to stimulate the willingness of pesticide users to recover independently, the government should reduce the cost of administrative law enforcement and contribute to the construction of rural ecological civilization.

Retailers thus need strategic insights into which factors increase customers’ return propensity and when the short-term costs of returns might be offset by future customer purchases. This article reports two studies that use transaction data from two large apparel e-tailers. Study 1 demonstrates that due to the differences between mobile and traditional online channels, consumers form a larger consideration set when they shop through mobile channels, and this distinctive search practice spills over onto return rates. That is, return rates are lower in mobile channels, and the use of the mobile channel also alters the effect of discount promotions. The findings in Study 2 suggest that future purchases by consumers, after a return, are contingent on category characteristics.

In this study, we study a retailer's MBG policy with dynamic pricing of limited inventory. A key decision for the retailer is to decide whether to offer MBGs. When the product can be returned instantly, we find that the optimal MBG policy is a simple threshold policy: given the inventory level, it is optimal to offer an MBG if and only if the remaining selling time is longer than a threshold. Moreover, the threshold is decreasing with the inventory level. We also address the problem of dynamic pricing with positive return times. Due to the complexity, we analyze the associated fluid model, which has an infinite number of constraints. We consider a series of relaxations that have a nested structure and use the Lagrangian approach to explicitly solve these relaxed problems. This allows us to develop an iterative approach that is guaranteed to solve the fluid model in finite iterations. Our numerical analysis shows that the deterministic solution is asymptotically optimal for the stochastic system. © 2021 Production and Operations Management Society",dynamic pricing; money-back guarantee; product return; revenue management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120316112

Such an expansion in business scope and the wide spread of lenient return policies trigger tremendous return volume that requires great deal of logistical efforts. The service levels offered within online stores greatly affect channels’ demand. However, they also influence the channel choice of return for online customers, if applicable, when their purchases are unsatisfactory. Therefore, this paper studies the optimal service level for a centralized DCR. In addition, it examines the optimal levels for a decentralized two-echelon system through the implementation of Nash and Stackelberg theoretical frameworks. Important properties of optimal solutions and vital managerial insights have been devised through analytical and sensitivity analysis. It is found that a DCR may have the following tradeoff: decrease service level to increase the reward from the physical store or increase service level to enhance competitiveness of the online store. The optimal decision depends greatly on how sensitive the customers’ return behavior is to service level. In addition, as the exogenous price increases, the change in the retailer’s offered level depends significantly on the different rates of return. © 2022 by the author.",conflict management; coordination; customer returns; dual-channel retailer; Nash game; service level; Stackelberg game; two-echelon,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138650597

The complex and multidimensional nature of product return influences the manufacturer, product, retailer, channel, return policy, logistics service provider, customers, or any combination thereof. Compared to other economies, the level of product return is high in an emerging economy like India, which prompted this structured literature review. The literature pointed to the product return as a ‘moment of truth’ involving emerging practices like buy online return in store (BORIS), wardrobing, renting, bracketing, home-try programs, subscription than buy, and sending of curated choices to customers, which drastically change purchases as well as returns. The return policy, dynamic pricing, website design and usability, product category, and inventory visibility influence product returns. Fraudulent returns are of concern compared to legitimate returns. Customer attitude, information-seeking behavior, post-purchase dissonance, individual and group decisions, and different temporal variables make customers sensitive to return. Additionally, the product utility, competitive and comparative value, perceived fairness, and customer empowerment also influence returns. Switching physical processes to online creates an additional challenge. A comprehensive understanding of product return in online purchase situations is expected to create value for customers and agents in the value chain.

To develop the study, we used a qualitative methodology through a content analysis of 21 expert interviews. From these interviews, we derived challenges and enablers for different CE elements in the categories reduce, circulate products, circulate materials, and shift towards renewable resources. Our findings indicate trade-offs related to the high complexity and functionality of many products, the juxtaposition of extremely technical and less technical products, and the low product return rate as challenges, while design for durability, design for repairability, and linking the degree of circularity to product types were identified as enablers. Based on our data, we argue that among circular practices reduce should form a basis upon which other aspects can build, with durability and repairability best suited for technical outdoor gear. As our study adds an industry-specific perspective, it contributes new knowledge to the CE literature. It also helps managers with the practical implications, as we argue they should be aware of potential downsides of CE elements and thus consider carefully which of those elements can help support their overall business and sustainability strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we propose a quantitative framework for a responsive reverse supply chain where a retailer processes the returns. Under a competitive full refund policy by the retailer and utilising price inversely influenced demand for a given period, we formulate a holistic profit maximisation model for the entire planning horizon. We derive closed form solutions for the optimal sales price and quantity of processed returns for a particular period and derive the effects of some key parameters on the decision variables. A primary result is that the average selling price is always lower with processing. Furthermore, the value captured from the processing of returns increases as the product becomes more expensive to acquire. Lastly, the value gained from processing additional returns is always declining for each additional period of delay, indicating the importance of adopting a responsive returns management process.

As a result, many retailers take various return leniency measures to ease the applicability of product returns for customers, which increases the frequency of returns in the market and has huge economic impacts on retailers. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately understand the impact of return leniency on both retailers’ profit and consumers’ welfare to outline return leniency strategies wisely and maximize profit and social welfare. We present a comprehensive model considering the impacts of major factors influencing customer behavior, such as return leniency, customer heterogeneity, and the endowment effect, in addition to the other frequently researched aspects in the literature (i.e., product expenses, hassle cost, salvage value). Our model calculates the probability of purchasing, keeping, and returning products to demonstrate the impact of return leniency, determining the optimal price and refund levels to optimize the retailer's expected profit and the consumer's loss, and optimizing social welfare. We use a set of numerical experiments over a wide range of parameter values that could cover almost all practical circumstances. Among other findings, our analysis shows that return leniency can be beneficial or detrimental to the retailer depending on the product acquisition cost, endowment effect, and product salvage value, which usually increases social welfare up to some level. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Endowment effect; Product pricing; Product return; Profit maximization; Return leniency; Social welfare maximization,Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Profitability; Salvaging; Endowment effect; Monopoly markets; Product pricing; Product returns; Profit maximization; Retail market; Return leniency; Return policy; Social welfare; Social welfare maximization; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128456777

Taking into account the product's selling price, greening level, and the EP's service level, this article investigates two types of return policies, viz. refund and replacement policies for defective products and EP's exchange offer in a green e-commerce supply chain. It constructs four decentralized models and determines optimal decisions by using the manufacturer-led Stackelberg gaming approach. Subsequently, a compensation-based profit-sharing contract is designed to investigate channel coordination. Analytical and numerical studies are used to compare and verify optimal decisions. The results show that (a) the replacement policy provides better outcomes compared to the refund policy, (b) the commission is negatively related to the manufacturer's decisions and profit; even a higher commission is not favorable for the EP, (c) besides providing win-win outcomes to both the channel individuals, the proposed contract is capable of enhancing overall performance.

Most papers investigating pricing problem in closed-loop supply chain field (CLSC) supposed that reproduced items’ quality is identical to produced ones. However, in practice, these items are perceived as two different products from customers’ perspective. Therefore, this paper extends a joint pricing model of manufactured–remanufactured items regarding different demands for produced and reproduced items which have different price and quality. We incorporate sales price, quality level, advertisement, return policy, and cross demand into demand expansion for newly produced items, and we discuss the introduction of collection effort and return policy into the quantity of return function. In this study, we investigate two distinct models. In the first model, we presume that there is no remanufacturing, so manufacturer sells products to retailer, and after that, the retailer sells them to customers. In the second model, with-remanufacturing which is comprised of three members (i.e., manufacturer, retailer, and third party) is discussed. Based on two different models, two decentralized problems are discussed for analyzing the best solutions of price, quality, and effort. Managerial insights indicate that adding reverse channel can greatly benefit both companies and environment and can also enhance firm’s position in the competitive market. Further to managerial insights, we determine and compare the optimum solution of two models, and we discuss the model that most benefits the manufacturer, retailer, and customers, respectively. Then an example is provided to simulate the developed problems and run sensitivity analyses to draw some interesting conclusions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Game theory; Quality of products; Remanufacturing; Return policy; Sales and collection efforts,,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144086994

However, operating the BOPS channel requires additional investment, which is a challenge for retailers. This article considers the pricing strategies of competing dual-channel retailers, focuses on whether and when they should adopt the BOPS strategy, and explores the impacts of market factors on the equilibrium outcomes. Since retailers' decisions are usually made sequentially in reality, we use the Stackelberg game model to analyze retailers' optimal strategies. First, we show that the follower's price is not always lower than the leader's price. Specifically, when the unit additional profit from cross-selling of the follower is low enough, the follower will set a higher price than the leader. Second, we find that retailers prefer the BOPS strategy when the fixed costs for offering BOPS channels are low enough, or when the difference between the additional profits from cross-selling of two retailers is sufficiently large. Third, we present an interesting insight: an increase in product return probability or retailer cost of handling a returned product can be beneficial to retailers.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Buy online and pick up in store (BOPS); competition; electronic commerce; omnichannel retailing; pricing; stackelberg game,Electronic commerce; Pickups; Profitability; Sales; Buy online and pick up in store; Cross-selling; Dual channel; Game models; High price; Market-factors; Omnichannel retailing; Optimal strategies; Pricing strategy; Stackelberg Games; Costs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133343430

Although a firm can recover value from DPRs through refurbishing, consumers are known to act strategically in anticipation of the future availability of refurbished units. We study a firm’s strategy for offering a new product and refurbished DPRs to strategic consumers across time. Academic/practical relevance: Aided by emerging shopping tools, an increasing number of consumers consider buying refurbished versions of products rather than their new counterparts. A novel contribution of our work is the recognition of the refurbishing of DPRs as a possible solution to the time inconsistency problem that arises when a firm offers products to strategic consumers across time. We characterize how the product line decisions and profit of the firm are influenced by the defect rate, the perceived quality of refurbished DPRs, and consumers’ hassle cost of returns. Methodology: We develop a two-period game-theoretic model to characterize the firm offering the new product and refurbished DPRs to strategic consumers across time. Results: The refurbishing of DPRs helps the firm implicitly commit to limiting the quantity of the new product offered in the future, allowing the firm to charge a premium for the new product today. As a result, firm profit may even increase with the defect rate. These results persist across various model extensions. Managerial implications: Whereas the firm’s profit is the highest when there are no defects, opportunities to achieve marginal reductions in defect rates may not be worth the investment and may even be counterproductive. Also, efforts toward enhancing the perceived quality of the refurbished product or decreasing the hassle cost for consumers may better serve the firm than efforts toward marginally improving defect rates. © 2021 INFORMS",defective product returns (DPRs); refurbishing; strategic consumers; time inconsistency,Defects; Game theory; Across time; Defect rate; Defective product return; Defective products; Perceived quality; Product management; Product returns; Refurbishing; Strategic consumer; Time inconsistency; Profitability,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132223373

In this setting, the outcome of a case may refer to whether a given case led to a customer complaint or not, or to a product return or other claims, or whether a case was completed on time or not. Existing approaches to train such predictive models do not take into account information about the prior experience of the (human) resources assigned to each task in the process. Instead, these approaches simply encode the resource who performs each task as a categorical (possibly one-hot encoded) feature. Yet, the experience of the resources involved in the execution of a case may clearly have an impact on the case outcome. For example, specialized resources or resources who are familiar with a given type of case, are more likely to execute the tasks in a case faster and more effectively, leading to a higher probability of a positive outcome. Motivated by this observation, this article proposes and evaluates a framework to extract features from event logs that capture the experience of the resources involved in a business process. The framework exploits traditional principles from the literature to capture resource experience, such as experiential learning and social ties on the workplace. The proposed framework is evaluated by comparing the performance of state-of-the-art predictive models trained with and without the proposed resource experience features, using publicly available event logs. The results show that the proposed resource experience features may improve the accuracy of predictive models, but that depends on the process execution context, such as the type of process generating an event log or the type of label that is predicted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Predictive process monitoring; Process mining; Resource experience,Process control; Process monitoring; Signal encoding; Business Process; Encodings; Event logs; Predictive models; Predictive process; Predictive process monitoring; Process mining; Resource experience; Runtimes; Train model; Encoding (symbols),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116780120

Reducing returns can help e-retailers mitigate these negative consequences. This article focuses on ecommerce returns due to satisfaction-related reasons, the most common reasons for ecommerce returns, and studied the use of return credits (a maximum free returns amount) to reduce these kinds of returns. This novel approach is different from full or partial return policy documented in existing literature. This article also studied the side effects of using return credits. A one-factor (credit amount: high vs. low) between-subject scenario experiment was conducted. ANOVA was used to test hypotheses. The results revealed that using return credits can significantly deter returns, while the high and low credit amount have a similar effect on deterring returns. Moreover, the high credit amount leads to weaker side effects than the low amount. These findings can help e-retailers decide whether to introduce return credits to manage returns, and help them design their return credits. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Perceived fit; Product returns management; Repurchase intention; Return credit; Returns reduction,Electronic commerce; % reductions; One-factor; Perceived fit; Product return management; Repurchase intention; Return credit; Return policy; Return reduction; Side effect; Sales,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143216574

Product returns prediction can be beneficial in taking business decisions in e-commerce. This research is based on an e-commerce company in India with nearly 25% product returns as a case study. Logistic-regression-based statistical analysis was used to predict the dichotomous dependent variable (product returns). Product size, payment mode, price, quantity, ZIP codes, and states were considered as independent variables. A decision support system was proposed based on the variables and a machine learning approach. A total of 3,187 past orders were used to train the model, which was applied in a one-month pilot study. The model could predict 60% of correct product returns with an overall efficiency of 87%. The case company used these predictions to take preliminary decisions on predicted return orders, saving 17% of the costs associated with product returns.  © 2022 IEEE.",Decision support systems; logistic regression; machine learning; online retail,E-learning; Electronic commerce; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Online systems; Business decision supports; Business decisions; Case-studies; Decision support applications; Dependent variables; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Online retails; Product returns; Product sizes; Decision support systems,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146313212

This paper establishes a dual-channel supply chain composed of one manufacturer and one retailer under mass customization. The manufacturer sells standard products offline via the retailer when providing modular customized products online. Two online distribution strategies of the manufacturer are considered: The manufacturer can choose direct or agency sales through the retailer's online channel. Additionally, the return policy of modular customized products available online is explored. A Stackelberg game model is proposed under each return scenario (with and without online consumer returns) to derive the optimal solutions for different channel strategies. Then, the influence of different parameters on the optimal modularity level and product prices is investigated under each model. Through sensitivity analysis, we found that the cross-price sensitivity coefficient of dual channels has a considerably positive impact on optimal decisions. Furthermore, the manufacturer's channel strategy and return policy decisions are examined. The result indicates that direct sales should be chosen if manufacturers’ online channel operating costs are lower than a certain threshold that increases with the revenue allocation ratio under agency sales. When the market demand of the product that is allowed to be returned is much more sensitive to the refund than its return quantity, a full refund policy should be offered for online customized products. These conclusions also apply to the return scenario where full refunds are provided for both standard and customized products. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Dual-channel; Mass customization; Modularity level; Online distribution strategies; Return policy,decision making; optimization; price dynamics; sensitivity analysis; supply chain management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126591809

With the advent of e-commerce and online shopping, there has been a growing interest in product returns and the associated impact on inventory variance and the bullwhip effect. In this paper, a novel four-echelon closed-loop supply chain model is presented, where base-stock replenishment policies are modelled by means of a proportional controller. A stochastic state-space model is implemented, initially to capture the supply chain dynamics while the model is analysed under stationarity conditions with the aid of a covariance matrix. This allows the bullwhip effect to be expressed as a function of replenishment policies and product return rates. Next, an optimisation method is introduced to study the impact of the Internet of Things on inventory variance and the bullwhip effect. The results show that the Internet of Things can reduce costs associated with inventory fluctuations and eliminate the bullwhip effect in closed-loop supply chains. © 2021, The Author(s).",Bullwhip effect; Closed loop supply chain; Control theory; Internet of things; Inventory control; State space,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107612478

The stochastic parameter is modeled as a scenario tree and therefore the concerned problem is formulated as a multistage mixed-integer stochastic program. To alleviate the computational complexity of the proposed model, it is decomposed into smaller scenario cluster submodels associated with a number of subtrees that share a certain number of predecessor nodes in the original scenario tree. The submodels are coordinated into an implementable solution via a Lagrangian-progressive hedging-based method that employs a viable Benders decomposition based algorithm for solving each scenario cluster submodel.

We analyze return policies (RPs) with cash refunds in the presence of wardrobers. We then analyze RPs with store credit or gift cards (SC/GC) refunds. We also analyze two-option RPs in which consumers choose between cash and SC/GC refunds. We find that for cash-only RPs, the retailer uses price to attract consumers while using the refund fraction to discourage wardrobers. SC/GC can be a good alternative to cash when consumers have high valuation for SC/GC and some SC/GC are not redeemed. With high redemption rate, SC/GC can be a good alternative when consumers make hedonic purchases and the retailer has a reasonable profit margin. We also find that single-option RPs dominate two-option RPs when genuine consumers and wardrobers have the same valuation for SC/GC, and two-option RPs can dominate when the two consumer segments have heterogeneous valuation for SC/GC. When two-option RPs dominate, the retailer gives lenient SC/GC option to genuine consumers who have a high valuation for SC/GC, and uses the cash option to decrease the cost or increase the profit from wardrobers who have a low valuation for SC/GC for some ranges of problem parameters. Moreover, when consumers have continuous valuation for SC/GC, two-option RPs dominate single-option RPs in genuine-only consumer markets.

However, studies seldom quantified the effects of long-term straw return on a long-term SOM variation at a regional scale in typical black soil areas. The case was conducted in one of the three major black soil regions in the Northern Hemisphere, where the straw return policy has been implemented for a long time. The study obtained the SOM spatial distribution in 2007, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018 with approximately 9000 samples and analyzed the effects of soil types, texture, elevation, and human management on the spatiotemporal variation. The results indicated that from the 1980s to 2007, before the straw return policy implementation, the mean SOM content decreased from 24.38 g kg−1 to 18.94 g kg−1. In contrast, the mean SOM content gradually increased from 2007 to 2018 after implementing straw return practices. In addition, the area of SOM within 20–30 g kg−1 increased gradually, with 32.2%, 40.5%, 50.2%, 49.4%, and 60.5% in 2007, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018, respectively. Surprisingly, the SOM within 30–40 g kg−1 emerged in 2018. The results indicated that returning straw to the field might promote SOM accumulation. However, the SOM contents in Phaezems (19.25–21.82 g kg−1) were lower than that in natural Phaezems (40–60 g kg−1), indicating severe degradation. The clay content positively correlated to SOM and was a major explanatory variable for the response of SOM to straw return. Straw return practices are promising measures in the black soil region and are worth exploring more effective approaches to allow straw return to play a better role. © 2022 by the authors.",environmental factors; geostatistical analyses; soil organic matter; straw return,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140407166

These marketing instruments can not only impact sales, but also product returns. However, when assessing the performance of marketing instruments, retailers often ignore potential return effects.

In this paper, we empirically examine whether, and how a comprehensive set of marketing instruments (newsletters, catalogs, coupons, free shipping, paid search, affiliate advertising and image advertising) affects product returns. We use data from two major online retailers and show that return effects vary largely across marketing instruments. Surprisingly, none of the instruments reduces product returns. Newsletters, paid search, catalogs and free shipping increase returns substantially by up to 18%. For free shipping and catalogs, the return effects emerge prevalently for fashion categories, whereas online advertising and newsletters increase returns of both fashion and non-fashion products.

When consumers incur a lower resale transaction cost than the retailer does, the retailer does not offer any return, but it can benefit from consumer resale for a high product resale value. When consumers incur a higher resale transaction cost, the retailer opts to offer a return policy for a wider range of the product resale value compared with no consumer resale. However, the retailer may suffer from consumer resale especially when the product resale value is moderate. Moreover, contrary to the result that the retailer always benefits from a higher product resale value without consumer resale, we find that the retailer's profit may decrease in the product resale value with consumer resale. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",,Costs; Profitability; Consumer resales; Return policy; Transaction cost; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106968536

This can easily cause trained models to overfit to the majority classes, categories or intents, leading to model miscalibration. The uncalibrated models output unreliable (mostly overconfident) predictions, which are at high risk of affecting downstream decision-making systems. In this work, we study the calibration of models in the practical application of predicting product return reason codes in customer service conversations of an online retail store; The returns reasons also exhibit class imbalance. To alleviate the resulting miscalibration in the trained ML model, we streamline the model development and deployment using focal loss (Lin et al., 2017). We empirically show the effectiveness of model training with focal loss in learning better calibrated models, as compared to standard cross-entropy loss. Better calibration, in turn, enables better control of the precision-recall trade-off for the trained models. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,Computational linguistics; Decision making; Learning systems; Retail stores; Building machines; Data distribution; Empirical studies; Exposed to; Google+; Imbalanced data; In-buildings; Long-tail distribution; Machine learning models; Miscalibration; Economic and social effects,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152906379

Communicating product information accurately, especially fit, is necessary as fit has been estab-lished as a critical component of customer satisfaction and reduces costs of returned product. Returns in the apparel industry have increased significantly due to the increase in online sales, suggesting that improved product fit and size communication is needed to improve consumer trust and satisfaction as well as increase profit margins and reduce environmental impact.

Less is known about the efficacy of bundling in settings where customers are less sure about their valuations for a product, especially when that product is newly launched or has an experience nature, and can conduct costly search to learn the product content and discover their true valuations. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between product bundling and customer search and its implications for a monopolist's optimal pricing strategy. Academic/practical relevance: The existing search theory has focused on decision making that selects the best among multiple alternatives, with costly search being mandatory for the acquisition of each alternative. In this paper, we introduce a framework of multiproduct demands and nonobligatory search, where customers demanding multiple products strategically decide whether to conduct costly search to resolve valuation uncertainty, while reserving the right to purchase these products without having to search them first. Methodology: We apply a nonobligatory search framework to study two different markets: (1) a market of one mature and one new product, in which valuation uncertainty exists for the new product only; and (2) a market of two new products, in which valuation uncertainty exists for both products. The firm fully anticipates the customers' search behaviors, determines whether to bundle these products or unbundle them, and optimally sets prices. Results: We show that bundling cultivates search in a market of one mature and one new product, but inhibits search in a market of two new products. This contrast emerges as a result of market structures: Bundling reduces the appeal of search by making the search decisions sequential and path-dependent in the latter market, but is less effective in doing so due to the existing heterogeneity in the former market. Our results thus point to an intricate interplay between customer search, market heterogeneity, and prices and their joint impact on the monopolist's optimal bundling strategy. We also study mixed bundling and show that its economic benefits only carry through when customers' search cost is not too large. In this case, mixed bundling can lead to considerable revenue improvement in a market of one mature and one new product, but only tiny revenue improvement in a market of two new products. We also study the joint management of product return and product bundling and show that a positive refund should generally be offered for returned products to stimulate customers' no-search purchase. Managerial implications: Our paper provides guidance for firms selling multiple experience or new products. We propose product bundling to manage customer search, identifying regimes for its economic benefits and clarifying its implication for customer welfare.

While bot-resolver helps automate some traffic, we still see high demand for human agents, also called subject matter experts (SMEs). Customers outreach with questions in different domains (return policy, device troubleshooting, etc.). Depending on their training, not all SMEs are eligible to handle all contacts. Routing contacts to eligible SMEs turns out to be a non-trivial problem because SMEs’ domain eligibility is subject to training quality and can change over time. To optimally recommend SMEs while simultaneously learning the true eligibility status, we propose to formulate the routing problem with a nonparametric contextual bandit algorithm (K-Boot) plus an eligibility control (EC) algorithm. K-Boot models reward with a kernel smoother on similar past samples selected by k-NN, and Bootstrap Thompson Sampling for exploration. EC filters arms (SMEs) by the initially system-claimed eligibility and dynamically validates the reliability of this information. The proposed K-Boot is a general bandit algorithm, and EC is applicable to other bandits. Our simulation studies show that K-Boot performs on par with state-of-the-art Bandit models, and EC boosts K-Boot performance when stochastic eligibility signal exists. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Arm Eligibility; Bandit; Customer Service Routing; Nonparametric,ARM processors; Artificial intelligence; Nearest neighbor search; Sales; Stochastic models; Arm eligibility; Bandit; Contextual banditti; Customer service routing; Customer-service; High demand; Nonparametrics; Real- time; Service routing; Subject matter experts; Stochastic systems,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144026315

From past two decades, the studies on digitalization of supply chain activities considering resource scarcity, reuse and remanufacturing have engrossed attention from academia about fundamentals of Closed-Loop Dual-Channel Supply Chain (CLDSC). In this paper, a two-level CLDSC consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer, and an e-tailer is considered as a formal buyer and used product collector. The study's main idea is to evaluate optimal pricing and effort decisions for CLDSC scenarios namely; vertically integrated, decentralized, partial retail, partial direct and horizontally integrated scenarios. A Stackelberg game theory and backward induction method is used to get the optimum values of decision parameters (selling price, buyback price, sales effort, and collection effort). Their relations are established, measured and compared to show managerial insights and proportional measures. A numerical illustration with sensitivity investigation is furthermore presented to simulate the effects of channel preferences, price coefficients, sales, and collection effort coefficients for price and effort optimization on decision parameters. As a managerial implication, this analysis helps the channel members to make strategic decisions about CLDSC and choose the best fit channel structure. The findings of this research elucidates partially integrated scenario executes optimum performance in terms of cost and effort both; one can compare the optimum values and predict the outcomes. © 2022 The Author(s)",Closed-loop dual-channel supply chain; Pricing and effort decisions; Return policy; Stackelberg game,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135449706

Furthermore, this study analyzes the impacts of the service cost coefficient and the consumer loyalty of the offline channel on the optimal price, service decision, and profit of different integration modes. This study also compares the profits of enterprises under centralized and decentralized decisions. The results show that centralized decision making can improve the service level of the SA (Store Assistance) effort and the sustainable performance of the supply chain. Whether the BOPS channel is managed by the manufacturer or retailer, the service cost, the product return rate, and the offline channel consumer loyalty have an impact on the decision of product sale price, wholesale price, and SA effort service level. Offline customer loyalty is less sensitive in the BOPS channel managed by the retailer than that managed by the manufacturer. It is suitable for the manufacturer to manage the BOPS channel when offline customer loyalty is low. Otherwise, it is appropriate for the retailer to manage the BOPS channel. The profit of the supply chain under the decentralized decision is less than that under the centralized decision. When executing a wholesale price contract, different omni-channel integration modes can alleviate the double marginalization effect. It can fully coordinate the supply chain members, motivate retailers to improve the service level of the SA effort, and realize Pareto improvement to support supply chain sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

As manufacturers strive to streamline operations and deliver consistent services across channels, this article analytically examines whether those who sell their products directly online and off-line through retailers should direct control, delegate to retailers, or outsource to third parties the delivery of these services. Our main findings are as follows. Manufacturers should not outsource demand-enhancing services to third parties if they do not ensure relatively low operating costs, as they reduce the level of service provided to customers. Assuming no channel partner has a cost advantage in service delivery, manufacturers should directly control the provision of services that are used identically by online and off-line customers. Manufacturers may not be able to directly and cost effectively offer services that are used differently by online and off-line customers. In such a context, depending on the relative sizes of off-line and online market bases, retailers may be considered either as single providers of the service for both online and off-line customers or jointly with manufacturers as providers for off-line customers only. We discuss the implications of these findings. © The Author(s) 2021.",channel efficiency; demand-enhancing services; dual-channel; game theory; omni-channel; pricing,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108340441

One major application of refunding policy emerges in online product sales. In this case, consumers can be refunded by returning goods that are against their interest. Examining three scenarios including refunding, bundle reservation, and refunding along with bundle reservation policies, this study will investigate the viability and performance of a model for each corresponding scenario. Then, the attempt is to compare two refund and bundle reservation pricing policies in a two-level supply chain including one manufacturer and one wholesaler. Then, a combined model including two products is provided. The demand is constant and also, the population-related information about the division of the population into two types of consumers is available: strategic consumers (consumers able to predict the second-stage discount) and myopic consumers (consumers unable to predict the secondstage discount). In addition, the percentage of consumers who refund the product due to regret, inability to install the product, etc. is constant and independent of the amount of refund. It was found that the combined model was optimal and had a higher profit margin than any other policy alone.  © 2022 Sharif University of Technology.

For instance, marketplace and web-store are two e-channels for selling goods directly to end customers. In the marketplace, manufacturers sell their products directly to online customers through e-tailers' platforms and share revenue with e-tailers. In the web-store channel, manufacturers sell their products directly to end customers through their platforms and do not need to e-tailers' platforms. However, some manufacturers and e-tailers continue with reseller channel yet. Reseller channel is another conventional channel in which manufacturers distribute their products to e-tailers, then e-tailers choose retail prices and sell them to consumers. Therefore, with these three different channels, the key question is when and under what conditions manufacturers can choose marketplace or reseller channel in addition to their web-store channels to grow their market share. In this paper, we analyze these three different e-channels and the conditions that manufacturers adopt the marketplace or reseller channel. For this purpose, we consider a model with two manufacturers and one e-tailer in which the manufacturers have their web-store channels, and they are willing to adopt another channelـ reseller or marketplace. The manufacturers offer a return policy in their web-store channels as a competitive strategy for attracting more customers. We find that offering return policy in web-store channels has no effect on the choice between the marketplace and reseller channel, but it has an impact on the amount of manufacturers' profits in each channel. Also, we demonstrate that regardless of offering return policy, as the coefficient of cross-channel effect increases, the manufacturers' profits, whether they choose reseller channel or marketplace channel, increase. But, as the coefficient of cross-channel effect increases, the e-tailer's profit increases when both manufacturers choose reseller channel, otherwise decreases. If manufacturers offer a return policy, the e-tailer's profit is highest when both manufacturers choose reseller channel, and if they do not offer a return policy, the e-tailer's profit is highest when both manufacturers choose marketplace channel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Cross-channel; Game theory; Return policy; Supply chain management,electronic commerce; game theory; market conditions; retailing; spillover effect; supply chain management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090718999

Four studies reveal that consumers primed with time cues are less willing to return a product. Specifically, presenting time cues can reduce product returns by amplifying consumers' perception of time pressure and alleviating their psychological discomfort. Furthermore, private self-awareness is found to moderate the time-cue effect through perceived discomfort. The results are replicated even when time pressure and psychological discomfort are directly manipulated, supporting the causal account. This study contributes to the literature on consumer product returns by proposing the time-cue effect and its psychological mechanisms and helps retailers manage product returns using various time cues. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",consumer product returns; private self-awareness; psychological discomfort; time cue; time pressure,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127230134

Over the years, Logistic Service Providers (LSPs) have learned how to ensure resilience to confront uncertainties and risks triggered by adverse events. However, quite unlike any seen in recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic brings about unavoidable uncertainties and risks for the logistics industry. Yet, there is no common approach to contextualize how they interact together. We incorporate an empirical research design and make a threefold contribution: first, we identify uncertainties and risks that LSPs encounter during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate their prominence. Second, we unveil intertwined schemes of afore-identified uncertainties and risks and augment the understanding of their cause-effect structure. Third, we provide an uncertainty and risk assessment guideline for LSPs affected by threats emerging from unforeseeable crises. In this study, we combine qualitative work and the fuzzy DEMATEL method. Qualitative thematic analysis of in-depth interviews reveals the most important uncertainties (COVID-19 measures, employee welfare, forecast horizon, demand change, and government regulations) and risks (COVID-19 risk, delivery delays, supply chain disruptions, financial failure, and product returns) for LSPs. The fuzzy DEMATEL method shows that COVID-19 measures and COVID-19 risk are highly prominent and influence other factors. The results indicate that demand change, government regulations, and supply chain disruptions are net causers, and employee welfare, financial failure, forecast horizon, delivery delays, and product returns are net receivers. Distinctly, employee welfare is the most affected factor, empirically confirming that major risks for LSPs are related to the human factor. More investigation in our results suggests that supply chain disruptions and demand change, two factors triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, influence financial failure and forecast horizon, two factors associated with operational performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",COVID-19 pandemic; Fuzzy DEMATEL; In-depth interviews; Logistics service providers; Risk; Uncertainty,Forecasting; Laws and legislation; Personnel; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; COVID-19 pandemic; Demand changes; DEMATEL; Financial failure; Fuzzy DEMATEL; In-depth interviews; Logistics service provider; Supply-chain disruptions; Uncertainty; Uncertainty and risks; Finance,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123028479

However, with the development of online review platforms, an increasing number of consumers are engaging in social learning by referring to others' reviews to reduce valuation uncertainty. In this study, we investigate how social learning interacts with sellers' return policies. There are three main conclusions. First, when sellers have a relatively higher expectation of product quality (or simply the product quality is high), social learning makes the sellers offering either no-refund policies or partial-refund policies better off in terms of the increased profit. It will cause the no-refund sellers to choose higher prices and inventory, and the partial-refund sellers to set lower prices and refund amounts. Second, under social learning, the partial-refund policy tends to be more beneficial to sellers than both full-refund and no-refund policies; although, when the product quality is high, the no-refund policy tends to bring more benefits to sellers than the full-refund policy. Hence, sellers may finally switch to the partial-refund policy. Third, for partial-refund policies, more often than not, social learning increases social welfare when the product quality is high; specifically, in many cases, it increases not only the profit of the seller but also the welfare of consumers. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.",Bayes theory; product valuation uncertainty; return policy; social learning,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127429715

To this end, the research employs a qualitative approach based on semi-structured interviews collected in May and June 2020 for a sample of Generation Z consumers in China and Italy. Results show differences and similarities affecting consumers' willingness to return in the different stages of effective purchase behaviour. For instance, in the pre-purchase stage, Chinese consumers often show a limited interest in return policies since they usually prefer not to return and repurchase otherwhere the product to maximize their cost-benefit trade-off. In contrast, when retailers adopt return policies, Italian consumers are more interested in feeling protected against the risk of wrong purchases. Instead, both samples are very attentive in return and refund efficiency in the post-purchase stage, which are perceived as two discriminating factors in terms of repurchase from the same retailers.

In the supply chain strategy, operational functions, such as planning, purchasing, and financial affairs are considered all together. In the meantime, the coordination between manufacturers, distributors, and retailers is of great importance. Coordination through cooperation between distribution channels is necessary because of their potential for realizing significant profits. This study presents a mathematical model for a three-echelon supply chain. In this model, the effect of the strategy of returning goods on the amount of profit as well as on the optimal amount of wholesale-retail prices is determined. The three-echelon supply chain is represented by manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. In this study, social responsibility is considered in the model and channel coordination in this three-echelon supply chain is also considered. Hence, in addition to maximizing total profit, social responsibility is also taken into consideration. Channel coordination and optimization of the supply chain are considered in both centralized and decentralized modes. In the results, it was found that the quality of products in a consistent manner is always at a higher level than in a decentralized state. Also, it was found that if decisions are made on a coordinated basis, customers who return their goods will benefit from higher earnings than decentralized. Therefore, this model helps the firms to find out the structure, which has a better performance in terms of product quality, return policy, and social responsibility impact while reducing conflict between supply chain members. Also, through a coordinated system, firms can enhance the quality of products and return policy, which in turn improves customer satisfaction and profits. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Pricing; Return strategy; Social responsibility; Supply chain coordination,market conditions; optimization; policy approach; strategic approach; supply chain management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107860323

Despite extensive research having been undertaken in this area, there is a paucity of research in developing decision-making models, which may consider life-cycle span of product returns while selecting an appropriate reprocessing option for value reclamation in CE. In this research, we have contributed to the CE literature in three ways. Firstly, we have developed a comprehensive decision-making model that makes a trade-off between different recovery alternatives while considering a wide range of significant criteria to determine the most optimal recovery option. Secondly, we propose a two-phase mathematical model combining the Interval 2-Tuple Linguistic (ITL) model and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to overcome issues related to uncertainty and incomplete information in decision-making. Thirdly, it is one of the first studies to investigate and compare the implementation of product recovery in CE for short life cycle (SLC) vs. long life cycle (LLC) electronic returns. We validate the industrial applicability of the proposed model using real-world data collected from the Indian electronics industry.

High product returns not only put pressure on the retailers’ profitability, but also come at high societal and environmental costs. A central question then is whether multi-channel retailers can use their offline stores to help reduce product returns in the online channel without harming online sales. In an empirical study, we address this issue using data from a large Dutch shoe retailer. We develop a novel spatial model to estimate the influence of proximate retail stores on customers’ online shopping behavior, while controlling for spatial and customer heterogeneity. Results demonstrate that an increased offline channel presence indeed re-duces online returns, depending on the product’s risk profile, without significantly lowering online sales. Offline stores can thus be an effective and appealing way for retailers to mitigate the negative impact of online shopping related to product returns. © 2022 by the authors.

However, that view is outdated. E-tailers' product return practices have substantially evolved and customers' return behavior has considerably increased, in turn, influencing expectations of customers. Thus, a need arises to revise the understanding of how customers evaluate the quality of e-tailers' service during product returns. This study conceptualizes customer-perceived e-return service quality, identifies e-return's current dimensions, and offers directions for measurement. Design/methodology/approach: This study is conducted in two stages. The first stage follows an abductive approach, with a continuous back-and-forth movement between existing theory and two qualitative data sets to identify the dimensions of e-return service quality. Scale development process is started in the second stage to offer directions for measurement based on the empirically grounded dimensions. Findings: The conceptualization of e-return service quality identifies six dimensions: (1) owning of responsibility, (2) return convenience, (3) return remedies, (4) service team support, (5) site's return friendliness, and (6) returns diligence. The factor analysis supports the six-factor solution that can be employed for developing a valid scale in future. Practical implications: The study suggests that e-tailers who are looking to differentiate themselves through superior e-return service quality should focus on customizing their service through excellent performance on these dimensions. Originality/value: The paper updates and refines the understanding of service quality in the context of product returns service provided by e-tailers and thus offers a novel contribution. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Abductive research logic; e-tailing; Product returns; Returns management; Service quality,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136938037

The core concept of the circular economy is to improve resource efficiency and prevent valuable materials from leaking out of the system. Better use of increasingly scarce resources can provide both economic and environmental benefits. When excess inventory, returned products, and end-of-life products are disposed of improperly, unnecessary waste is created, often with a detrimental impact to the environment. An effective system must exist to facilitate the proper handling of these products, and secondary markets are a crucial component in this system.

However, little is known about how online sellers can improve consumers' online return experience. This research examines whether an instant refund service can improve the online return experience. To obtain a comprehensive view of the outcomes of using an instant refund service, this paper also examines how the use of an instant refund affects several pivotal consumer responses. Study 1 analyzed the effects of an instant refund service on consumer responses in a post-purchase pre-return scenario, and Study 2 analyzed the effects of instant refunds on a set of key variables in a post-purchase post-return scenario, including satisfaction with the online return experience. For each study, the hypotheses of the effects of an instant refund on consumer responses were discussed, and a one-factor (instant refund service, yes vs. no) between-subject scenario experiment (with an additional related experiment in study 1) was conducted, using online panel data from Wjx.cn. One-way ANOVA was used to test the hypotheses. It is concluded that an instant refund service increases consumer satisfaction with the experience and improves other consumer responses. In terms of potential side-effects, instant refunds are not significantly associated with stronger product return intentions. These findings can help online sellers decide whether to evolve their conventional refund mode to a new instant refund mode. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Instant refund service; Online return experiences; Procedural justice; Re-purchase intention; Return intention,business development; business service; electronic commerce; panel data,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133694631

By reducing the inventory levels and inventory costs and lessening resource waste, enterprises can efficiently achieve green growth. To realize green transformation, enterprises need to form a closed-loop system from product design to resource recovery and utilization and then implement the coordination of “green” and “growth”. Therefore, inventory management and control in a closed-loop system plays an important role in the green growth model and value chain reconstruction. Demand information mutation or the bullwhip effect of the supply chain is one of the important reasons for a high inventory level. It refers to the transmission of the market demand information from the downstream retailer to the upstream supplier throughout the value chain in the course of the fluctuation and variation. The bullwhip effect will cause higher inventory levels and inventory costs for the supplier. And the demand information distortion increases the risk of production and inventory management for upstream suppliers in the value chain and even can lead to the disruption of production and supply. To efficiently achieve the green growth of enterprises through efficient inventory management, this chapter focuses on the impact of the product return, remanufacturing, and different value chain structures on the bullwhip effect and inventory costs based on statistical theory and methods. We analyze the coordinated control measures of the bullwhip effect under different scenarios to lower the inventory levels and inventory costs of the enterprises. The analysis will help enterprises better achieve the green growth model and the green transformation of the value chain. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160473586

The products are extracted periodically or quantitatively for inspection in order to observe the relationship between process variation and engineering specification. When these irregularities are not instantly detected by lot sampling inspection, lot defectives are produced, and the defective cost increases. Failure to identify defects during sampling inspection leads to product returns or harm to business reputation. Press casting is a common mass production method in the metal industry. After the metal is molten at a high temperature, high pressure is injected into the mold, and then it is solidified and formed in the mold. Thus, pressure stability inside the mold is one of the key factors that influences quality. The melting point of aluminum alloy is normally around 650 °C, but there was no sensor that could withstand this high temperature. To combat this, we developed a high temperature resistant sensor and installed it into pressure casting mold grounded on the principles of fluid mechanics and experts’ suggestions in order to realize the impact of pressure change on the mold. To our limited knowledge, it was a seminal study on predicting mold’s casting quality via in-mold pressure data. We propose a press casting quality prediction method based on machine learning. By collecting the in-mold pressure data in real time. Savitzky-Golay Filter is used for data smoothing, and first-order difference is taken to extract the time interval of an actual injection of molten metal in-to the mold. We extract the key data that influence the quality and employ XGBoost to establish a classifier. In the experiment we prove that the method achieves good accuracy of quality prediction and recall of defectives for in-mold pressure. Via this model, we not only can save large amount of time and costs, but also can carry out maintenance warnings in advance, notify professionals to stop produce defective products, reduce the shipping risk and maintain reputation so as to strengthen its competitive edge. © 2022 by the authors.",machine learning; press casting; quality prediction; supervised learning,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136366872

E-commerce platforms can provide useful information to assist consumers to make rational decisions, but they are often filled with useless, repetitive, and even false excessive information, which will lead to information overload and impulsive decision-making of consumers. Most of the previous literature focuses on reverse logistics, return policy, and consumer behavior tendency, etc. From the perspective of consumers’ perception of information displayed on e-commerce platforms, there are few research endeavors on the formation mechanism of perceived information overload on consumers’ return intention. Taking perceived information overload as an independent variable and consumers’ perceived environmental effectiveness as a moderation variable, this study constructs a chain mediation model that affects consumers’ online return intention. Based on the analysis of the mediating effects of impulsive buying behavior and cognitive dissonance, this study explored the moderating mechanism of consumers’ perceived environmental effectiveness on the chain mediation model. The results show that perceived information overload has a positive influence on online return intention through impulsive buying behavior, and perceived information overload has a positive influence on online return intention through cognitive dissonance. Perceived information overload also positively affects cognitive dissonance through impulsive buying behavior and thus has a significant positive chain mediating effect on consumers’ online return intention. More importantly, this research shows that consumers’ perceived environmental effectiveness can significantly moderate the chain mediation path by reducing the positive effect of the cognitive dissonance on online return intention. On this basis, this study put forward the corresponding managerial implications from the perspectives of consumers and e-commerce platforms. © 2022 by the authors.

This study focuses on uncovering the role of consumer behaviour in designing an appropriate product recovery framework. Drawing insights from prospect theory, where a consumer would react more severely to losses than gains, we develop a probability function to model consumers' willingness to accept a promotional offer as a function of the discount offered to them on returning their used products. The developed model captures the loss aversion characteristic of consumers by incorporating their budgeted price for a new product and the deviation of the actual price from the budgeted price. The propositions suggest that experiencing a higher deviation of the actual price from the budgeted price increases the likelihood of consumers accepting the promotional offer. However, the result reverses if the absolute deviation crosses a threshold value. These propositions have been validated through empirical analysis of experiments conducted with 500 participants. Further, an analytical model is developed to determine the optimum discount to be offered to consumers to return their used products, to minimise the cost of collecting used products through promotional offers. The analysis shows a trade-off between the incentive offered through promotion and the penalty cost for not satisfying government regulations. Overall, this study's findings aid in framing an effective incentive mechanism that could be used by decision makers to improve the performance of the product return management process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Budgeted price; Consumer behaviour; Incentive; Product return management; Promotional offers; Prospect theory,Budget control; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Laws and legislation; Product design; Acquisition process; Budgeted price; Circular economy; Incentive; Loss-aversion; Performance; Product return management; Promotional offer; Prospect theory; Used product; Consumer behavior,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131461968

Motivated by practical observations, we explore a supplier's distribution channel strategy when introducing return window in both centralized and decentralized supply chain systems. A game-analytical model is developed to study the interaction between channel strategy and return window. The equilibrium channel strategies, return windows, and prices in the two systems are derived. We find that a long return window always tends to be offered by the supplier when the direct channel is open (in a dual-channel or single direct-channel strategy) since it expands potential market demand. Also, the supplier provides a shorter return window in the decentralized than the centralized system as the existence of double marginalization, which enriches existing results. We prove that introducing return window always restricts the supplier to choose a dual-channel strategy, but it incentivizes (restricts) the supplier to choose a single retail-channel strategy in the decentralized (centralized) system in response to changing cost pressures. Our theoretical findings provide insights for managing supply chains when introducing return window as a market strategy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Channel strategy; Game theory; Pricing; Return window,Game theory; Supply chains; Centralized systems; Channel strategies; Decentralised; Direct channel; Dual channel; Online channels; Return policy; Return window; Specific time; Supply chain operation; Costs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137178096

Interestingly, compared with a setting with no returns, although the retailers’ clearance price will be lower, we show that they would be better off with flexible return policies when the bargain hunter segment’s valuation heterogeneity is above a certain threshold. We show that this result holds in both store-clearance and the two types of off-price clearance-channel settings in which multiple retailers clear their excess stock through an intermediary. We also show that the expected clearance price in off-price clearance channels is higher than the clearance price in store-clearance setting with and without returns.

Being a major logistics hub in ASEAN, Thai government has initiated several projects to support the transportation of people and goods. Road transportation is a major mode of goods transportation in Thailand. However, it incurs the highest logistics cost compared with water and rail modes. The use of multimode transportation is, therefore, considered to lower the logistics cost and reduce the environmental problems. This study examines the feasibility of multimodal transportation of cassava products in the long-term utilizing the system dynamics modeling approach. Six saving elements, including 1) saving in labor cost, 2) saving in fuel cost, 3) saving in carbon dioxide tax, 4) saving in truck rental cost, 5) saving in reimbursement cost, and 6) saving in accident cost, and four cost elements, including 1) handling cost, 2) tariff cost, 3) product return cost, and 4) product damaged cost, are considered in the dynamics model. The simulation results reveal that at the initial years, the net cash flow is negative due to high investments in double track system. Once the project continues, the savings increase. It is found that the project is feasible when it is continued for 10 years at the internal rate of return of 13.69%. The sensitivity analysis results also show that the saving in truck rental cost and the product damaged cost are two key elements in the multimodal transportation, as they highly affect the internal rate of return of the project. The developed dynamics model of multimodal transportation of cassava products can be used as a guideline for transportation companies and government to plan for their multimodal transportation to reduce logistic costs and achieve benefits in the long term. © 2022 Penerbit UTM Press.

However, their profitable distribution is often difficult because BOP customers are risk-averse, their ability to pay (ATP) is lower than their willingness to pay, and they face uncertainty regarding these products' value. Academic/practical relevance: We examine two practical strategies from distributors in the BOP: (1) improving the product's affordability through a discount and (2) increasing awareness of the product's value. Our results identify BOP-specific operational trade-offs in implementing these strategies. We also propose strategies to manage these trade-offs that can increase consumer surplus in the BOP. Methodology: We introduce a supply chain model for the BOP and analyze the distributor's pricing problem with refunds as well as the distributor's optimal budget allocation between strategies (1) and (2). Results: We find that, in the BOP, the distributor's profit-maximizing budget allocation often yields the lowest consumer surplus. This misalignment between profits and consumer surplus disappears if customers' ATP is high. Moreover, the misalignment can be resolved if the distributor offers free product returns and commits to a maximum retail price. We confirm the robustness of our results through numerical simulations. Managerial implications: Best operations strategy practices in the BOP can differ significantly from developed markets. Furthermore, BOP customers' limited ATP and high risk aversion generate a BOP-specific misalignment between profits and consumer surplus. Operational commitments, such as free returns, reduce this misalignment and can serve as a signal to investors of a social enterprise's focus on consumer surplus.

Such a hybrid system, commonly found in the photocopier and personal computer industries, has received considerable attention in the literature. However, its dynamic performance and resulting bullwhip effect, under push and pull remanufacturing policies, remain unexplored. Relevant analysis would allow considering the adoption of appropriate control strategies, as some of the governing rules in a push-based environment may break down in pull-driven systems, and vice versa. Using nonlinear control theory and discrete-time simulation, we develop and linearise a nonlinear stylised model, and analytically assess bullwhip performance of push- and pull-controlled hybrid systems. We find the product return rate to be the key influencing factor of the order variance performance of pull-controlled hybrid systems, and thus, to play an important role towards push or pull policy selection. Product demand frequency is another important factor, since order variance has a U-shaped relation to it. Moreover, the product return delay shows a supplementary impact on the system's dynamics. In particular, the traditional push-controlled hybrid system may be significantly influenced by this factor if the return rate is high. The results highlight the importance of jointly considering ordering structure and product demand characteristics for bullwhip avoidance. © 2021 The Author(s)",Bullwhip effect; Closed-loop supply chains; Nonlinear dynamics; Push and pull production; System dynamics,Discrete event simulation; Discrete time control systems; Personal computers; Supply chains; Bullwhip effects; Closed-loop; Closed-loop supply chain; Ordering policies; Performance; Policy choices; Product demand; Product returns; Pull production; Push and pull production; Hybrid systems,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118997548

In this inventory control problem, the item’s demand is deterministic and occurs at a known constant rate over time. Product returns arrive according to a Poisson process. The amount returned to the seller at each return epoch is a random or fixed fraction of the accumulated number of units (net of previous returns) that have been demanded so far within a stock cycle. The ordering policy is a continuous review policy that orders a fixed quantity every time an order is placed. The replenishment lead time is instantaneous, and shortages are not allowed. The objective is to find optimal order quantities by minimising the long-run average total costs per unit time. Costs include a fixed plus proportional cost per order, and a holding cost per unit held in inventory per unit time. A level-crossing approach is used to derive a closed-form expression for the expected ordering and inventory holding costs as a function of the order size and other relevant parameters. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Inventory control; level crossing method; lot sizing; Product returns; stochastic,Railroad crossings; Stochastic systems; Cost per unit; Deterministics; Holding costs; Inventory control problems; Inventory systems; Level-crossing method; Lot sizing; Optimal stocking; Product returns; Stochastics; Inventory control,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144035454

Logistics application, such as the southern banana transportation to the country, major cities can buy all the year round; Xinjiang ha honey melon, Ningxia white orchid melon, northeast rice, Tianjin small station rice are not seasonal supply market. However, with the increasing frequency of logistics activities, its damage to natural resources and ecological environment is becoming more and more serious. The waste produced in logistics is increasing day by day, which puts great pressure on the environment. Such as steel slag, industrial waste water, waste computers, waste batteries and other kinds of inorganic waste. Goods return is the most important activity in the green reverse logistics. Because reverse logistics is a kind of logistics activity including product return, logistics replacement, item reuse, waste disposal, reprocessing, repair and remanufacturing and other processes. Returns are the key part of it. In order to ensure the goods, return to the manufacturer and get good disposal, it is necessary to record the whole process information of the goods from the factory to the customer. Blockchain is a chain composed of one block after another. Each block holds certain information in each block, which are connected into chains in their respective chronological order. Based on this, this paper proposes a sustainable development strategy of green reverse logistics based on blockchain. In the strategy research, based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering and high information security of blockchain technology(BT), this paper proposes a commodity traceability scheme based on blockchain. In this traceability scheme, this paper uses the structure of Merkel tree to design a license chain to store detailed commodity traceability information, and stores the Merkel tree root node of the license chain block in the public chain, forming a “double chain” structure of commodity traceability system. The simulation analysis shows that the traceability information stored in the license chain can use the high security of the public chain to ensure the security of information. Compared with the traditional blockchain, the double chain structure designed in the article, has a larger throughput, which can trace the source of the product to the manufacturer, ensure that the goods can be returned to the manufacturer for further processing, reduce the generation of waste in the logistics, and provide a guarantee for promoting the sustainable development of green reverse logistics. © 2022 The Author(s)",Blockchain technology; Commodity traceability scheme; Green reverse logistics; Merkel tree; Sustainable development,Blockchain; Forestry; Manufacture; Planning; Security of data; Slags; Waste disposal; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Chains structure; Commodity traceability scheme; Double chain; Green reverse logistic; Major cities; Merkel tree; Reverse logistics; Traceability information; Sustainable development,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138101052

This paper argues that effective management of this trade-off requires a deep understanding of the process through which consumers perceive, evaluate, and respond to return policies that vary in terms of leniency across five key dimensions identified in the literature: monetary, time, effort, scope, and exchange. To this end, we theorize on a cognitive process model and empirically test the model using randomized experiments with diverse consumer samples. By viewing each of the five leniency dimensions as returns service design levers, we examine (1) how a retailer's return policy leniency across different levers impacts a consumer's intention to purchase from a retailer, through the influence of leniency on the perceptions regarding returns service quality and transaction costs that jointly form perceived returns service value, and (2) how different leniency levers are compared in terms of their impacts. We find significant heterogeneity in the effectiveness of different leniency levers in influencing consumers' purchase intentions through increased perceived service quality, reduced perceived transaction costs, and subsequently increased perceived service value. © 2021 Production and Operations Management Society.",consumer returns; mediation analysis; return policy; service design; vignette-based experiment,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122265535

This paper addresses the TBYB retailer's problem in its operations: the decision regarding how many items to send to a consumer to maximize its expected profit when the products are chosen by a retailer recommendation system. To this end, we develop a stylized model of the retailer's quantity decision by taking into account the consumer's purchase decision, which is influenced by the consumer's budget constraint and the retailer's recommendation accuracy. We derive the retailer's optimal quantity decision and discuss how it is determined. We also examine how the retailer's optimal quantity decision and corresponding profit are influenced by two factors reflecting the TBYB industry: recommendation accuracy and new consumer influx. Regarding recommendation accuracy, our results show that a minimum level of accuracy exists, which acts as an entry barrier to TBYB retail. Once the retailer's accuracy exceeds the threshold, we show that the relationship between the accuracy and the optimal quantity is characterized as an inverted-U relationship. Regarding the latter, interestingly, we find that an influx of new consumers may hurt the retailer's profit even when the accuracy applied to them is above the entry barrier. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",E-commerce; Product return; Recommendation system; Retailing; Try-Before-You-Buy,Budget control; Electronic commerce; Profitability; Recommender systems; Consumer purchase; Expected profits; Multiple items; Online retails; Optimal quantity; Product returns; Recommendation accuracy; Retail operations; Retailing; Try-before-you-buy; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118532104

In the unlikely event that customized products do not match expectations, however, consumers often feel entitled to a return. Should firms offer returns on customized products? We examine this question via a Stackelberg game model, in which the firm (leader) decides the prices and returns policies for its customized and standard products; consumers (followers) decide which product to buy, given the initial noisy valuations and, upon experiencing the product, whether to return it. Both parties act strategically: Forward-looking consumers incorporate the real option value of possible returns into their initial purchasing decisions, and the firm incorporates consumers’ best purchase and return response into its pricing and returns policy decisions. Our model produces three key insights. First, firms can use customized products to induce some consumers who otherwise would buy and return a standard product to switch to lower-return-rate customized products. Second, it may be optimal to offer returns on customized products, despite their lower salvage value. Third, firms can increase profits and reduce (total) returns by offering returnable customized products.

Specifically, the authors focus on five strategies: (1) the addition of online channel by an offline retailer; (2) the addition (or subtraction) of offline channels by an online retailer; (3) addition of mobile shopping channel (website and/or app) by offline and/or online retailer; (4) cross-channel integration strategies; and (5) retail marketing mix strategies. The author/s integrate findings from empirical research on these strategies into a number of ‘insights’ about ‘what we know’. Prominent among these are the following: Adding a transactional online channel to an offline channel improves the retailer's overall sales even though offline channel sales can be cannibalized to some degree. Adding an offline channel by an online retailer, however, boosts online channel sales as well as overall sales of the retailer. Similarly, adding a mobile shopping channel usually increases customer purchase frequency and amount and overall sales of the retailer in the long-term. Strategies for greater cross-channel integration generally have a positive effect on a retailer's overall performance while online advertising has positive effects on offline channel consideration and sales as well as overall sales of a multichannel retailer. Other insights or findings that need further study or open questions are also identified.

The rise of omnichannel retailing has changed consumers' buying habits, and manufacturers are facing stiff competition from retailers. To reduce this competition effect, manufacturers and retailers often work together to reduce showroom display costs. Despite this practice, there is little understanding of how omnichannel retailing impacts supply chain (SC) profit under competitive conditions. We investigate the test-in-store-and-buy-online (TSBO) retailing strategy and its impact on SC profit and price competition between manufacturers. The retailer sells products of both manufacturers through its website but displays products of only one manufacturer in the showroom, which bears the displaying cost. The retailer adopts a return policy for the other manufacturer. Stackelberg game was used to examine how members of the chain interact, and Nash equilibrium was used to find optimal strategies for players under decentralized and integrated channels. The results show that the TSBO strategy in retailing benefits all supply chain players under the integrated channel. A further interesting finding is that omnichannel SC profits are highest when retailers adopt a return policy. When two manufacturers compete and adopt different sales models, the manufacturer who uses the TSBO retail model reaps the most profit.

The pandemic affected conditions of apparel retailers: downstream among consumers and upstream among suppliers. It induced retailers to accelerate the adoption of technologies to make their supply chains more flexible and resilient. Before COVID-19, the apparel industry had gradually adopted virtual dressing room (VDR) technologies and crowd wisdom software, both of which reduce the risk associated with online purchases. Apparel retailers also altered the structure of their supply chains by outsourcing product turns via third-party logistics providers. This article analyzes how changes in market demand and supply conditions following the outbreak of COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of VDR technologies. The analysis is based on a conceptual microeconomic model of adopting technologies and changes in the supply chain. We support our theoretical findings with business cases.

The 7Ps of the marketing mix were used as a framework to shed insights for marketing strategies. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study using personal interviews was designed. A convenience sample of 24 young adults from 20 to 22 years of age was asked to take photos, showing the exterior and interior of their favorite shop in Hong Kong. They were interviewed face to face to explain why they like these shops. Other information about the shopping context, including frequency of visits and whether shopping alone or with friends, was collected. Findings: The favorite shops of young adults are clothing retailers and stores for snacks. Attributes of favorite shops include stylish product design, variety of choices, cozy physical environment, technology-assisted shopping process and customer-friendly return policy. Young adults seek taste and artistic presentation in consumption. Self-expression and social communication of consumption play a major role in retail brand love. Research limitations/implications: The sample size of this study was small and may not be generalizable to populations of different socioeconomic status. A quantitative survey can be conducted to further examine the topic. Practical implications: This study deepens the understanding of how young adults perceive product, store and process attributes of shops that are related to retail brand love. Tangible qualities such as product and physical space played a more important role than intangible attributes such as friendly frontline or sales staff. The results imply that retailers need to pay attention to a shop’s product offering, interior design, as well as develop a seamless integration of online and offline shopping processes to engage customers. Originality/value: There are very few studies of young consumers and retail brand love using qualitative methods.

Under the monopoly case, we find that if the product can satisfy consumers’ tastes with a high possibility (we call it a low mismatch rate in this paper), then the e-retailer inclines to provide a RFI policy for consumers even when the consumer can make a voluntary RFI purchase decision. Under the competition case, we find that the e-retailer’s RFI strategy is not only dependent on the mismatch rate but also on the consumer’s preference for the e-retailer’s RFI policy. When the mismatch rate is sufficiently high, there exists a counterintuitive strategy for the e-retailer regarding the consumer’s preference for RFI. That is, the e-retailer may not offer RFI policy even when the consumer’s preference for such policy is high. Moreover, when the mismatch rate is within a lower range, then the e-retailer can always hold a profit advantage by adopting a RFI policy that conflicts with his rival’s benefit. We also find that the cross-sales effect in the buy-online-pick-up-in-store channel has a negative impact on the e-retailer’s equilibrium price and profit, and the returns handling cost of the e-retiler always hurts his profit under the monopoly situation while makes it possible to increase the profit when the return handling cost is relatively low under the competition situation. Lastly, when the BOPS retailer extends to the omni-channel mode, the proportion of offline consumers influences the e-retailer’s RFI strategy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Buy-online-pick-up-in-store channel; Cross-sales effect; Retail competition; Returns freight insurance; Returns policy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126191583

We formulate the profit function of each members of the chain using direct accounting approach as a careful method, considering sustainability costs and return policy to produce and supply multiple products. Two different scenarios for product return are studied considering return amount as a variable or a given parameter. After a numerical example according to an Iranian supply chain that supplies various petrochemical products, a sensitivity analysis related to three parameters of the problem that imposed return functions of products has been conducted.

E-tail product returns are essentially acquisition of products that have been sold through purely online or brick-and-click channels and then returned by consumer to business. Design/methodology/approach: Using a systematic literature review protocol, we identified 75 peer-reviewed articles on e-tail product returns, conducted bibliometric analysis and content analysis of the articles and summarised our findings. Findings: The findings reveal that the subject of e-tail returns is a new research area; academics have started to investigate several aspects of e-tail returns through different research methodologies and theoretical foundations. Further research is required in leading e-commerce countries and on key areas such as omni-channel returns management, customer satisfaction and service, the impact of resources such as people skills, the benefits of technology and IT systems in managing e-tail returns. Practical implications: The study offers a summative account of current e-tail knowledge areas, which can serve as a reference guide for e-tailers to develop strategies for more efficient and competitive product returns. Originality/value: This study contributes theoretically by developing clusters of key themes or knowledge areas about e-tail returns. It also provides a conceptual framework for e-tail returns management, which can be used as a springboard for further empirical research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",E-tailer; Literature review; Product returns; Returns management,Product design; Bibliometrics analysis; Bricks and clicks; Design/methodology/approach; E-tailers; Knowledge areas; Literature reviews; Product returns; Returns managements; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Customer satisfaction,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116649699

The utilized dataset includes 6 out of 15 corporations that reflect around 90% of the total market capitalization under the mining and extracting sector in the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). The sample consists of 126 observations from 2000 to 2020. It should be noted that estimating the efficiency of the sector based on time series for each company is not mentioned in the literature review. Therefore, we applied BCC (Banker-Charnes-Cooper) models to estimate performance efficiency and compared between input and output models under DEA. We also estimated the average performance efficiency of the sector to detect weaknesses/strengths among companies. The market capitalization and the operating revenue are used to evaluate the companies' performance. In addition to the performance variables as output to the DEA models, the current assets, non-current assets, operating expenses, and general administrative expenses are also used as input variables under the DEA models. This study also examined the effect of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and Return on Assets (ROA) on performance efficiency scores for BCC models. In the results, we found that there are differences in performance efficiency across time series in each company based on dynamic BCC models. It is observed that the performance efficiency of NAST Company is better than the other companies based on BCC (Input/output). The GDP growth and ROA reveal the effect on efficiency performance under BCC models. The proposed model can be used to improve the performance efficiency of companies in stock exchange markets. © 2022 Jamil J.

We construct an endogenous matching probability model depending on the ex ante strategic choice among various product value delivery measures, such as displaying product information online, opening product reviews, building a virtual showroom, and building a physical showroom. This model is different from the exogenous matching probability assumption in the literature. When the matching probability is exogenously given, the retail price reduction policy is commonly used to mitigate product value uncertainty. In contrast, when retailers can determine the matching probability through the ex ante strategic choice for the product value delivery measures, increasing the retail price to rely more on ex ante value delivery may be optimal in the mitigation of a more serious product value uncertainty. In addition, we examine the interaction between the ex ante product value delivery and the ex post return policy. The results show that the adoption of the ex post mitigation policy may encourage or discourage the adoption of the ex ante mitigation policy depending on the cost input for product value delivery and the customers’ surplus loss caused by a mismatch. © Operational Research Society 2021.",e-commerce; endogenous matching probability; Marketing; pricing; product value delivery; product value uncertainty,Probability; Mitigation policies; Probability modeling; Product information; Product reviews; Product value; Return policy; Strategic choice; Value delivery; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105142252

This paper aims to synthesise research developments in the PR domain in order to provide an insightful picture of current research and explore future directions for the research community. To ensure research rigour, we adapt a six-step framework - defining the topic, searching databases, cleaning and clustering data, paper selection, content analysis, and discussion. A hybrid approach is adopted for clustering and identifying the distribution and themes in a large number of publications collected from academic databases. The hybrid approach combines machine learning topic modelling and bibliometric analysis. The machine learning results indicate that the overall research can be clustered into three groups: (1) operations management of PR, covering (re)manufacturing network design, product recovery, reverse distribution, and quality of cores; (2) retailer and (re)manufacturer issues including return policy, channel, inventory, pricing, and information strategies; and (3) customer's psychology, experience, and perception on marketing-operation interface. Furthermore, from the content analysis, five potential future directions are discussed, namely digitalisation in the context of PR; globalisation versus localisation in the context of PR; multi-layer (i.e., retailer, manufacturer, logistics provider, online platform) and multi-channel (i.e., online, offline, dual and omni channel) oriented bespoke return policy; understanding and predicting customer return behaviour via online footprints; and customer return perception across the marketing–operations interface. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bibliometric analysis; Framework; Literature review; Machine learning; Product returns; Topic modelling,Electronic commerce; Industrial research; Information management; Machine learning; Product design; Quality control; Bibliometrics analysis; Content analysis; Framework; Hybrid approach; Literature reviews; Marketing-operations interfaces; Product returns; Return policy; Systematic literature review; Topic Modeling; Sales,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117717957

Both the manufacturer and the competing contractor (which also produces a product in its own brand) face customer returns. We find that the manufacturer's optimal outsourcing strategy depends strongly on two factors: the efficiency of production and sale of its brand relative to that of the competing contractor in its own brand, and the ratio of the qualities of the two brands. The competing contractor, on the other hand, always prefers to produce for the manufacturer. Interestingly, we find that when the manufacturer chooses to outsource to the non-competing contractor, both the wholesale and retail prices of the manufacturer's product decrease, while they increase if the competing contractor is chosen. In addition, the competing contractor may be chosen even if it charges a higher wholesale price than the non-competing contractor does. We find that the manufacturer and the competing contractor should offer money-back guarantees if they can efficiently recover value from any returns. We further show that when a non-competing contractor is chosen, money-back guarantees offered by the manufacturer and the competing contractor can benefit at least one firm and may even achieve a win-win situation. When the competing contractor is chosen, both the manufacturer and the competing contractor can either benefit (Pareto improvement) or suffer (prisoner's dilemma) from money-back guarantees. These results are different from those in existing studies in the literature. © 2021",Outsourcing; Pricing; Returns policy; Sourcing strategy,Contractors; Manufacture; Outsourcing; Public policy; Sales; Optimal outsourcing; Outsourcing strategy; Pareto improvements; Prisoners' Dilemma; Retail price; Return policy; Sourcing strategies; Whole sale prices; Win-win; Costs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109217784

The reviewed literature documented that 10–15% of the online products are returned and in many cases such products are not shelf-ready due to product obsolescence or slight wear and tear, thereby reducing profits. Many of these products are disposed of in landfills. There were very few publications that documented how integration of digitized product life cycle into the business model improves product returns and the remanufacturing processes. As societies continue on, environmentally re-sponsible, digital journeys with connected devices and people, reverse supply chains and remanu-facturing will play increased importance in fulfilling customers expanded expectations. The networks are evolving, wherein, data are collected from all phases of the product lifecycles from de-sign, prototype, manufacturing, usage aftermarket, returns remanufacturing and recycling. The objective of this paper’s authors was to describe how all phases of product life cycles can be digitized to improve global reverse supply chains and remanufacturing. The authors performed a literature review and developed case studies to document current and to predict future transformational waves that will become increasingly used in many industrial sectors. The authors made recommen-dations about the importance of improved product design, reduced processing costs and increased use of remanufactured products based upon data on returns to manufacturers and service provid-ers.

Both external and internal forces guide this choice for consumers: the fear of sanctions for acting in a manner that society considers unacceptable, and guilt resulting from violating their own internal ethical standards. This paper examines how the interaction of these forces determines the likelihood of unethical consumer behavior. We find that when an unethical behavior is more socially acceptable, even if illegal, individual differences in guilt proneness have greater bearing on a consumer's decision to behave unethically. However, the role of individual guilt proneness matters less when the unethical behavior is less socially acceptable. The results are consistent across numerous settings in which the firm offers varying degrees of license to consumer to act opportunistically, and potentially unethically (i.e., abusing merchandise return policies, illegally downloading media, and paying small amounts in pay-what-you-wish situations). Our findings reveal boundary conditions of the effect of guilt proneness on ethical behavior suggesting that managers potentially can curtail unethical behavior through making a behavior less socially acceptable, or by influencing the context of the unethical behavior. © 2021",Consumer ethics; Guilt; Moral compass; Pay what you want; Piracy; Social acceptability,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111975231

To improve the returns experience, retailers have forayed into omnichannel return operations and consumers are sophisticated enough to make strategic channel decisions. Taking into account consumer disappointment aversion triggered by value uncertainty online, three return configurations were explored: non-return, same-channel return and omnichannel return and the impacts of disappointment aversion on the retailer's optimal pricing, return penalty, and profitability are investigated. The most important conclusion is that the effect of disappointment aversion on return strategy is influenced by distinct product return rate. We identify conditions under which the retailer should choose omnichannel return strategy and the other key findings show that the optimal pricing under a same-channel strategy should be no lower than the other two strategies, and depending on the level of unit travel cost, the optimal pricing is symmetric on different disappointment aversion intervals and the correlations are opposite. The return penalty keeps down with disappointment aversion. The retailer will implement a non-return policy only when return rate is relatively high. When both the return rate and the disappointment aversion is intermediate, the same-channel return is the optimal strategy. However, it is only profitable for retailers to implement an omnichannel return strategy when disappointment aversion is low, which supports for the retailer's choice of return strategies. © 2022",Consumer disappointment aversion; Omnichannel retailing; Pricing; Product returns,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138189571

Seller reputation becomes an important credential to shadow seller future behaviour. Most existing reputation models directly aggregate the ratings provided by past buyers. However, it is well documented in practical e-commerce systems that buyers’ ratings can be distorted due to collusion, which negatively affects the applicability of these reputation models. To address this challenging problem, we propose the repurchase-and-return reputation (3R) model, which puts buyers’ ratings into context before aggregating them to compute seller reputation. It considers buyer repurchase and product return behaviour after the point in time when the particular rating was provided. Intuitively, repurchases indicate that the buyers are satisfied with the previously purchased products. Thus, their positive ratings should be given more weight. Similarly, product return behaviours indicate that buyers are dissatisfied with their previous purchasing decisions. Thus, their negative ratings should be given more weight. Based on the proposed 3R reputation model, we design a price premium for a transaction considering the post-purchase behaviour of both the buyer and seller in their transactions. The proposed model is proven capable of achieving a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, in which sellers honestly provide products and buyers prefer to return bad products and repurchase good quality products. Experimental evaluation based on extensive simulation demonstrates that our model can accurately evaluate sellers’ honesty and perform well against prevailing unfair rating attacks. © 2021 The Authors",Product return; Repurchase behaviour; Reputation model,Electronic commerce; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Quality control; Context-Aware; E- commerces; E-commerce systems; Price premiums; Product returns; Purchasing decisions; Repurchase behavior; Reputation modeling; Seller reputations; Unfair ratings; Sales,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114130733

How do operational levers under a manufacturer s control affect return rates? Academic/practical relevance: Consumer returns raise major questions for manufacturers and retailers because losses related to returns are substantial. However, levers commonly used to discourage returns, such as strict return policies, can dampen sales, which is a significant drawback. The literature on consumer returns has focused on retailer and purchase attributes but has ignored whether manufacturers can take a proactive role to influence returns. Manufacturers and retailers have an interest in understanding how operational levers influence return rates. Methodology: This work attempts to answer questions about the influence of manufacturing on return rates by using detailed operational data from a leading U.S. manufacturer of automotive accessories. We study the impact of key operational levers on return rates by using a logistic regression model, while controlling for retailer return policies and numerous product, purchase, and consumer attributes. Results: We find that increased task-level worker specialization has a significant and U-shaped impact on return rates. Increased workload levels in production leads to a significant increase in return rates, whereas product personalization leads to lower return rates. Managerial implications:We provide an empirical estimate of the effect of operational variables on return rates that are useful in evaluating managerial trade-offs. Our findings suggest that allowing customers to personalize products can significantly reduce return rates. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

However, as it was expected that the follow-up phase would generate an increasing amount of reliable genetic results, an update of the return of research results (RoRR) policy became necessary. To inform this revision, an empirical study using mixed methods was developed to investigate the views of CHRIS research participants (20), local general practitioners (3) and the local genetic counselling service (1). During the interviews, three different examples of potential genetic results with a very diverse potential impact on participants were presented: breast cancer, Parkinson disease and Huntington disease. The CHRIS participants also completed a short questionnaire, collecting personal information and asking for a self-evaluation of their knowledge about genetics. This study made it clear that research participants want to make autonomous decisions on the disclosure or non-disclosure of their results.

Designing a waste-to-energy supply chain, focusing on its supply chain aspects, this study aims at converting the waste into profit, reducing the environmental pollution, and generating the energy from bio-waste. The proposed model considers a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a waste collection center and a biogas production plant. The rate of return at collection center is improved by employing effective return policy, which is modeled by using the sigmoid function. The collected bio-waste is converted into biogas and fertilizer at a biogas production plant. An energy feasibility condition is developed to decide the supply of required energy for operating the production plant from its own output. Besides fulfilling the plant's energy requirements, excess amount of the biogas and all the amount of fertilizer is sold in market for earning profit. The study objective is defined as total profit of the supply chain in form of a mathematical model, which is maximized by searching the optimal solution for cycle time and acquisition/incentive cost. The results of the study exhibit almost complete (97%) removal of the organic waste, production of a substantial amount of energy (14.8 MW), and creation of a significant amount of profit ($23908/month) for the considered setup. Based on the proposed feasibility condition, the environmental, economic and energy feasibilities of the WTE system are calculated in three different scenarios.

In recent years, mega-retailers have added resale service to their conventional business of selling new products, which is called the retailer-run resale market. Prior literature shows from the retailer's perspective that the ultimate motive for running resale business is to reduce the volume of consumers' product returns. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies on the retailer's resale business from the manufacturer's perspective. We adopt a manufacturer's perspective and derive strategies to motivate retailers to make decisions for the benefit of the entire supply chain in the presence of the retailer-run resale market using five commonly used types of contracts: revenue-sharing, buybacks, quantity flexibility, quantity discount, and two-part tariff. Ongoing digitalization and web security in retailing have provided a convenient environment for online transactions, which have emerged as a supply chain and become a staple for many shoppers. However, growing popularity of online shopping inevitably increases the volume of product returns because it lacks an opportunity to experience the product before purchase. Thus, an increasing number of online retailers have adopted a resale business unilaterally to reduce consumer returns. The study provides strategic guidelines for a manufacturer to induce such retailers to make decisions for joint profit maximization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Channel coordination; Product returns; Retailer-run resale market; Supply chain management; Uncertainty of product value,Electronic commerce; Manufacture; Supply chain management; Chain management; Channel coordination; Mega-retailers; Partial consumption; Product returns; Quantity flexibility; Retailer-run resale market; Revenue-sharing; Supply chain coordination; Uncertainty of product value; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102072332

The study found that manufacturers offering refund policies generate more sales in the direct online channel, while retailers choose to reduce the retail price of their products. It is important to note that price reductions by retailers have a very limited effect and do not lead to an increase in sales in the retail channel. Manufacturers offering refund policies will inevitably infringe on retailers' profits, and the variability of manufacturers' profits depends on the residual value of returned products. Manufacturers should decide whether to offer a refund policy in online direct sales channels based on the residual value of the returned product; otherwise, the action would be detrimental to themselves. The price of direct online sales is the same whether the manufacturer buys the return shipping insurance or the consumer buys the return shipping insurance, but when the return shipping insurance is bought by the consumer, sales are higher in the direct online channel and lower in the retail channel.

This paper develops a coordination mechanism for a closed-loop supply chain, operating under several policies to control the carbon emission, namely a carbon tax regulation, government incentives policy, green technology investment, and energy-saving investment. The carbon tax regulation is implemented to lessen the emissions from the manufacturer’s activities. Whereas, to encourage the manufacturer to cut down the emission as well as to increase the product return and energy savings, the government provides incentives based on a target level. The system operates under a variable market demand which is affected by the retailer’s selling price, green technology, and energy-saving levels. The proposed problem is formulated under two different scenarios, which are the centralized model and the decentralized model. To improve the supply chain coordination, we also propose two different contracts, namely the green technology revenue-investment-sharing contract (GRIS contract) and the energy saving revenue-investment-sharing contract (ERIS contract). The system inflicted with two types of inspection error in classifying the returned products. The models are formulated mathematically and optimized using a proposed algorithm. The result shows that the centralized model performs better in maximizing the total profit compared to the decentralized model. The results also imply that the government incentives toward product returns, green technology, and energy-saving actually affect the optimal decision of the supply chain system. In addition, the proposed contracts are proven to provide win–win solutions and improve supply chain coordination. © 2022 The Author(s).

B2C e-commerce has several benefits such as saving costs by decreasing the use of resources, increasing profits, and competitive advantage, especially in the pandemic context. However, this opportunity comes with challenges, and one of such is related to a significant number of products that are returned to the vendor or manufacturer. These challenges in the Reverse Logistics’ (RL) in the context of e-commerce become a new phenomenon – Reverse E-Logistics’ (REL), because the product in the e-commerce is physical goods or electronic ones like videos, music, books, etc. This study focuses on identifying the most critical factors that impact REL performance and discusses how REL can affect its performance. The methodology used is mainly a literature review, synthesis, survey methods, and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). This study is done in Lebanon and Syria with a sample of 412 companies that perform B2C e-commerce and are faced with REL’ . The results showed that out of the ten factors identified during the literature review, eight factors (management, employees, IT and technology, return policy and procedures/guarantee, infrastructure, organizational structure and culture, customer services/satisfaction, and quality management) have a positive correlation with REL performance. Moreover, improved REL performance results increase in companies’ performances. The business research model was created based on performed REL performance in Lebanon and Syria, and this gives new scientific insights and knowledge about REL specificity in developing countries. © 2021 The Author(s).

The first objective seeks to maximize the profit in a specific supply chain with three levels: Plants, distribution centers, and in the last level, customers. Since transportation is one of the major pollution sources in a distribution problem, the second objective is to minimize their emission. In the considered problem, the decisions of production, location, inventory, and transportation are made in an integrated structure. In developing the demand function, the effect of the product freshness and the price is formulated. Besides, to encourage customers, three strategies, including perished product return, discount, and credit policies, are proposed. Also, robust optimization is utilized to cope with the operational uncertainty of some cost parameters. To prove the applicability of this research and the feasibility of the environmental aspect, a case study is conducted. Finally, the numerical computations on the case study provide a trade-off between the environmental and economic goals and indicate a 37.5 percent increase in the profit using the developed model. © 2021 Materials and Energy Research Center.

Consider a supply chain consisting of a retailer and competing manufacturers. The retailer has a limited ordering capacity. The manufacturers compete for the retailer's orders by offering return policies. We show that in equilibrium, the manufacturers always offer full-credit return policies to the retailer. This result explains the inconsistency between the popular practice of full-credit returns and the theoretical argument that full-credit return policies are suboptimal. Compared with wholesale price contracts, return policies may cause fiercer competition between manufacturers and thus make the manufacturers worse off and the retailer better off. The manufacturers and the channel always benefit from an increase in the retailer's ordering capacity. However, the retailer's profit may decrease when its ordering capacity increases. Numerical studies reveal that when manufacturers can first commit to their contract types, wholesale price contracts can be their equilibrium choices when the retailer's ordering capacity is below a threshold; otherwise, full-credit return policies will be their unique equilibrium choice. This partially explains the coexistence of wholesale price contracts and return policies in practice. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",capacity; manufacturer competition; newsvendor; return policy/buyback contract; supply chain/channel,Sales; Supply chains; Capacity increase; Return policy; Theoretical arguments; Wholesale price contract; Manufacture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098192907

However, one of the challenges faced by online retail is its inability to provide customers with the opportunity to “touch-and-feel” a product before purchasing, thereby resulting in a higher rate of product returns. To address this, online retailers, nowadays, are adopting various omnichannel configurations. Using a stylized model, we study three such omnichannel configurations: selling the product online, establishing a showroom while selling the product online (‘Experience-in-Store-and-Buy-Online (ESBO)’), and selling the product through both a brick-and-mortar (B&M) store and the online channel while allowing in-store product returns (‘Buy-Online-and-Return-In-Store (BORS)’). Based on product attributes such as product standardization and valuation we recommend optimal omnichannel strategies. Our results show that depending on whether a premium product is highly personalized or standardized, opening an additional showroom or a B&M store becomes optimal for the retailer. In contrast, for a low-valued, highly personalized product, the retailer prefers opening an exclusive showroom. Otherwise, for a low-valued, standardized product, the retailer opens an additional B&M store or continues to operate only online based on the product return rate and valuation. If the unit cost of transporting the returned products from customers is low, the retailer prefers to sell the product online only. Moreover, if the hassle cost of online purchase is too high, the strategy of in-store return becomes uneconomic. We also analyze the impact of customers’ exchanging returned items at the B&M store and their product fitness heterogeneity on the retailer's optimal omnichannel strategy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",E-commerce; Omnichannel retailing; Product returns; Showrooms; Store returns,Costs; Electronic commerce; Digital technologies; Online channels; Online retails; Personalized products; Product attributes; Product returns; Product standardization; Standardized products; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096444472

Customers’ expected service is related to advertising effort and price. We build a two-stage decision making process to analyze the impact of expected services of customers. In addition, we analyze the parameter sensitivity and compare the competitive equilibrium strategies. The results show that the manufacturer will give a lower wholesale price to the retailer in some case. Furthermore, the dual-channel product returns will discourage advertising effort and the service level of the retailer, but it will enable the manufacturer to provide a higher service level. Thus, for managers, the survey of the expected service of customers is very important for the optimal strategies making, and it should not always blindly exploit the retailer’s profit for the manufacturer. Finally, when the physical store allows unconditional return of goods, the service level of the online channel will be more considerate. © 2022. Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization.

In these organizations, at least 60% of the assets correspond to inventory. Therefore, inventory record inaccuracy (IRI) is a problem among these companies. IRI is the gap generated between physical audits and system records, which affects the retailer by changing their book value, increasing economic losses, and providing poor customer service. This study aims to identify the factors that cause IRI in retail companies and, using a mathematical model, works to help retailers minimize the gap between registers. As a consequence, retailers can reduce potential losses in the company. Two mathematical models are proposed for each of the dependent variables: IRI and difference between records. The independent variables considered are quantity of sale of an item, cost, physical audit period, variety of products, product returns, sale price, and quantity sold. This work concludes by comparing both models, highlighting the most influential variables. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Difference between records; Inventory management; Inventory record inaccuracy; Product returns; Retail,Losses; Sales; Audit records; Customer-service; Difference between record; Economic development; Economic loss; Inventory management; Inventory record inaccuracy; Product returns; Retail industry; System records; Inventory control,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128491987

When a product is returned to an online retailer, the return shipping cost often falls upon the retailer. Our paper analyzes the optimal operational strategy for an online retailer that offers a “guaranteed return” policy to their customers. Under the guaranteed return policy, the retailer accepts all returns from customers and covers all of shipping costs incurred. The model is further extended to analyze the retailer’s operational problem of re-selling returned products. For the secondary market, under the re-selling strategy policy, the retailer does not accept returns and the product is sold “as-is”. The added profits the retailer generates from employing the re-selling strategy is quantified. Our model provides the threshold prices required for the retailer to sell the product for different operational strategies that are employed. Furthermore, we provide the optimal order quantity for a retailer who operates under demand uncertainty and return uncertainty. The optimal order quantity for a retailer who employs the re-selling strategy differs from a retailer who does not employ the re-selling strategy. At lower product price points, the retailer who does not employ the re-selling strategy orders more units than a retailer who does employ the re-selling strategy. Once the price point exceeds a threshold, the opposite is true. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Consumer return; Demand uncertainty; Ordering decision; Re-selling strategy,,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137792471

Fit describes how well a product suits a consumer's needs. The value of a product drops sharply when it deviates from a customer's ideal fit. In this study, we focus on ordinal fit, a type of fit attribute that can be ordered on a scale - for example, the size of apparel or the difficulty level of courses. By leveraging a change in the product-review system at an online retailer, we examine the impacts of two types of fit information - fit valence (an overall evaluation of a product's ordinal-fit attribute) and fit reference (a reviewer's ordinal-fit attribute and her choice of the product's fit attribute) - on returns of apparel goods. Using the lens of advice taking, we reveal the important role of the context of fit opinions (i.e., fit reference) in facilitating shoppers to better interpret fit valence by enabling effective ordinal-fit adjustment and, consequently, reducing product returns. We employ a predictive analytics framework for counterfactual prediction via the Generalized Synthetic Control method to address endogeneity issues and shed light on the dynamic treatment effect. Our findings indicate that fit valence alone can lower product returns only in a limited situation - when the majority of reviewers agree on the fit valence. In other cases - when either the fit valences are inconsistent or few and far between - it is the combination of fit valence and fit reference that lowers product returns. With the availability of both types of fit information, similar reviewers play an important role in helping improve the accuracy in ordinal-fit adjustments. Yet, albeit less effective, information from reviewers with dissimilar body sizes can also help make useful ordinal-fit adjustments. Besides, shoppers appear to benefit from both positive and negative fit valences, as long as they are aided by fit reference. Our empirical insights are relevant to many situations where ordinal-fit attributes dominate consumers' product-evaluation process. Accordingly, we provide useful implications for online sellers grappling with high product return rates.

Online shopping is now one of the main ways consumers shop. When consumers shop online, they tend to return products more often because they can purchase products only indirectly through videos, pictures, and text. Studies indicate that the average return rate of products bought from online retailers is 22%, approximately. In this context, more online retailers are developing physical showrooms to improve consumers′ shopping experiences and reduce the product return rate through the offline experience-online purchase (O2O) model, such as “Amazon 4-Star” and “JD E-Space stores”. However, the development of the physical offline showroom changes the original purchasing needs and habits of consumers and affects the decision-making process within the supply chain. In the face of consumer return behavior, the online retailer is often required to provide full refunds to consumers under the money-back guarantee. This dynamic increases the complexity of the decisionmaking process of the online retailer and the game relationship of the supply chain and tends to lead to dysfunctional decision incentives in the supply chain. Therefore, by constructing a two-stage game model between a manufacturer and an online retailer under different supply chain power structures, we aim to investigate how the O2O mode affects the optimal pricing decisions and profits of the online retailer and manufacturer. We also seek to understand how the money-back guarantee strategy affects the performance and consumer surplus of each enterprise and how the different power structures that also exist in the supply chain member companies affect the O2O model and the value of the money-back guarantee. Based on current research, we propose that manufacturers sell through the online channel of the online retailer, while online retailers also provide product experience services to consumers through the physical showroom. First, the expected utility function and product demand function under different purchase behaviors are established based on the heterogeneity of consumers and their uncertainty regarding the products. Second, considering power structure differences in the supply chain and the impact of the moneyback guarantee, three types of models are constructed under three power structures: manufacturer-led, retailer-led, and vertical Nash. Using these models, both the manufacturer and the online retailer aim to maximize their respective profits: the manufacturer decides the optimal wholesale price, and the online retailer decides the optimal retail price. By applying these models, one can obtain the supply chain equilibrium under the three power structures, analyze the influence of the O2O model and the money-back guarantee on the supply chain equilibrium and consumer surplus, and use a numerical example for visualization. The results of this research show that, depending on the product return rate and the return loss of the online retailer, the online retailer may not have the incentive to provide a money-back guarantee under different supply chain power structures. This is because the online retailer′s money-back guarantee results in an increase in the retail price of the product. We also examined the impact of the O2O model on supply chain equilibrium and consumer behavior and found that the O2O model attracts more consumers to experience products in a physical showroom, which in turn boosts product demand and reduces product returns. That is, in terms of increasing market share or reducing product returns, the online retailer always has an incentive to offer consumers a physical showroom. In addition, the comparative analysis also shows that the O2O model enhances the profits of manufacturers, online retailers, and the supply chain system. Finally, we also examine the impact of the O2O model and money-back guarantee on consumer surplus, which shows that the physical showroom consistently enhances consumer surplus under different supply chain power institutions and that the impact of money-back guarantees on consumer surplus depends on the product return rate and the consumer return cost. In summary, this paper investigates the money-back guarantee strategy of the online retailer and the impact of the O2O model on supply chain equilibrium by constructing a two-stage game model between a manufacturer and an online retailer. One of the limitations of this paper is that to simplify the model calculation process, it considers online retailers that sell only one product. Therefore, future research will further investigate the money-back guarantee strategy of online retailers using the O2O model in the context of multiproduct competition. © 2022.

However, generous refunds also yield unintended consequences such as opportunistic returns, which take place when customers intentionally rent a product for short-term use. Accounting for 11% of all product returns in the United States in 2017, opportunistic returns prompt retailers to seek tactics to address adverse revenue and cost implications. We consider two alternative proposals using a price- and refund-setting newsvendor framework with two customer types: honest returners and renters. The first proposal, targeted-refunds, uses retail analytics firms to distinguish renters from honest returners and implements return policies tailored for each segment. The second proposal, menu-of-refunds, presents customers multiple price-refund pairs and lets them self-select. We compare and contrast the optimal decisions and the profit implications of both proposals with respect to two benchmark settings: one without any renters and another proposal, uniform-refunds, wherein the retailer merely reoptimizes its decisions while acknowledging that renters exist. We characterize the conditions under which the menu-of-refunds proposal separates customer types and thus matching or exceeding the performance of the targeted-refunds proposal. Furthermore, we study several alternative model specifications to confirm that our main finding concerning the effectiveness of the menu-of-refunds proposal is robust. © 2021 INFORMS.",Consumer returns; Newsvendor; Operations/marketing interface; Retail,Costs; Equilibrium price; Model specifications; Newsvendors; Optimal decisions; Product returns; Retail operations; Return policy; Unintended consequences; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114502964

For these reasons, the EU institutions have repeatedly stated that voluntary returns are to be preferred to forced ones. One measure that can concretely encourage voluntary returns is that of Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes, which can be accompanied by initiatives to support the socio-economic reintegration of citizens repatriated to their country of origin. Given the disparity between how European countries conduct AVR programmes and the fact that little research has focused on this topic, the aim of the article is to present policies and procedures for AVR and reintegration adopted by the four largest EU countries: France, Germany, Italy and Spain. These four case studies were conducted by analysing the available documentation and by conducting interviews with stakeholders and individuals responsible for the implementation of AVR activities.

The Pact forms a clear break with the existing asylum acquis, wherein border procedures are exceptional and facultative.

This results in considerable costs to businesses due to complex returns systems, and environmental costs due to unnecessary transportation and waste. Unsustainable consumption poses a threat to our environment, and access-based business models whereby products are borrowed/rented rather than purchased have been proposed as a way to align customer needs, business success, and sustainability. Product returns often constitute a form of informal or illegitimate borrowing, as goods are bought with the intention of being returned. In this discussion paper we propose that, instead of being viewed as a threat to business, issues with high product returns could be seen as an opportunity to switch to an access-based model. As product returns escalate, businesses will need to invest substantially in their reverse supply chains. We propose that a more strategic approach might be to leapfrog the costly stage of developing more efficient returns systems, and move straight to formalising product returns as the new normal for those goods that would best suit an access-based model, so that processes are streamlined around borrowing and returning rather than around sales. © 2021 by the authors.

The application of reverse logistics by the manufacturers though serve the purpose but its success is highly dependent on the participation of the consumers. Hence, the present study is an attempt to gauge the level of participation of the consumers in the reverse exchange programs. Because of the predictability limitations of the typical Structural-Equation-Modelling models, the present study employs the deep learning of the dual-staged partial least squares-structural equation modelling artificial neural network approach. The findings of the study confirms the individual’s attitude as the most significant determinant of the intention to exchange, followed by level of awareness and norms, whereas perceived behavior control was found to be least important though significant.

As a result, many retailers take various return leniency measures to ease the applicability of product returns for customers. This, in turn, increases the frequency of returns in the market, which has huge economic impacts on retailers. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately understand the impact of return policy social welfare. To enable this, we present a novel, inclusive analytical model capable of capturing the impacts of major factors affecting the customers’ behavior, including return leniency, customers’ heterogeneity, and the endowment effect, in addition to the other commonly studied factors in the literature (product expenses, hassle cost, salvage value). In this model, we mathematize the probability of purchasing, keeping, and returning products. Utilizing these probabilities, in turn, help us determine the optimal price and refund levels to optimize the social welfare.

With this service, offline retailers cut their prices to match the online price if it is lower. In this paper, we establish a game model that involves an offline and online retailer in the presence of showrooming to analyze the impact of price matching. Specifically, we capture consumers’ uncertainty of product value and heterogeneous awareness of price matching and assume that the online retailer provides a free return policy. The results indicate that price matching alleviates showrooming and relaxes competition. Moreover, we find that the online retailer adopts a randomized pricing strategy if the offline visiting cost is moderate. We further show that the price matching strategy does not necessarily benefit offline retailers and hurt online retailers. Subsequently, we identify the offline retailers’ optimal conditions for implementing price matching. © 2022 The Authors.

We ask this question in the context of the multi-billion dollar global supply chain industry of fragile products that experience large overheads due to product returns. This paper presents MiLTOn, a novel acoustic and mm-wave based solution for through-box non-invasive product integrity sensing that is sensitive to even minute sub-mm cracks in the object. MiLTOn is inspired by acoustic vibrometry used for instance to monitor cracks in railroads. Unlike traditional vibrometry, MiL-TOn is unique in its ability to sense products non-invasively using an external transducer and microphone, neither of which are in direct physical contact of the object within the box. MiLTOn pro-cesses measurements from the microphone to design a robust and environment-independent product signature that can be used to sense presence of product defects.

Specifically, we consider a model where two homogenous e-tailers compete in a market. Each e-tailer sells one horizontally differentiated product to consumers through their online channel. E-tailers can cooperate with an exogenous third-party store channel provider in the market to offer BORS. They need to decide whether to offer BORS and then their retail prices. Results reveal that e-tailers will likely adopt BORS when consumer's online return cost and e-tailer differentiation are relatively large. Otherwise, e-tailers may choose to dismiss it. In terms of profitability, on the one hand, BORS introduction by both e-tailers does not affect their expected profits. On the other hand, BORS introduction by one e-tailer only benefits the one who offers BORS at most or may lead to a lose-lose outcome.

This study considered a two-stage CLSC consisting of an original manufacturer and a third-party recycler. Without any government policy support, considering the effects of market demand, product return rate, and consumer perceived value, a CLSC decision model based on market demand with a [0,1] distribution was established. The model analyzes three situations—a manufacturer monopoly, the Cournot duopoly game, and the Stackelberg competition game—and solves them. The optimal values of decision variables such as optimal pricing, market demand, and all parties’ profits in the CLSC are obtained, and a strict mathematical proof is given. Through the model-solving process, the effects of product return rate and consumer perceived value on decision variables are analyzed; then, the profit allocation between the original manufacturer and the third-party recycler under different cooperation modes is analyzed. In addition, the four combinations of competition and cooperation are analyzed based on game theory. The Nash equilibrium solution and Pareto optimal solution of the four modes are analyzed by drawing a bimatrix Nash equilibrium table. The results indicate that the cooperation–cooperation mode is difficult to produce automatically, and government policy guidance and support are often needed to achieve Pareto optimality. Finally, a numerical example is given to validate the proposed model. In this way, the proposed model provides reliable theoretical support for the decision-making of both sides in a CLSC. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Closed-loop supply chain; Customer perceived value; Game theory; Market demand; Profit model; Return rate,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092715269

A self-administered structured questionnaire was used for data collection. The empirical evidence from 155 social commerce customers shows that the number of positive review comments, seller popularity, and customer service quality has a negative influence on seller uncertainty. Moreover, customer service quality enhances the negative influence of the number of positive review comments on seller uncertainty. Furthermore, the study revealed that the seller that offers a lenient return policy in addition to good customer service quality experiences lower levels of seller uncertainty than the seller that only offers good customer service. © 2021 The Author(s)",Popularity; Return policy; Review comments; Seller uncertainty; Service quality; Signalling theory,Commerce; Quality of service; Customer services; Data collection; Online business; Return policy; Seller uncertainties; Social commerces; Sales,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110499353

Companies must have a well-managed reverse logistics system to ensure the timely and cost-effective col-lection, processing and disposal of returned products. However, high fixed cost of reverse logistics infrastructure and high level of uncertainty associated with product returns force companies to outsource their reverse logistics operations to third party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs). The success of outsourcing largely depends on the selection of suitable 3PRLP(s). Although there are many 3PRLP evaluation methodologies, the research on the determination of order quantities from 3PRLPs considering uncertainties associated with budget allocation and capacity is very limited. In addition, the previous studies do not allow decision makers to express their preferences for 3PRLP selection criteria in a physically meaningful way. This study fills these research gaps by proposing a novel 3PRLP evaluation methodology which integrates linear physical programming (LPP) and fuzzy programming (FP). First, an LPP model is constructed based on decision makers’ preferences and alternative 3PRLPs are ranked according to their total LPP scores. Then, an FP model takes total LPP scores, budget allocation and capacity constraints as input and determines the number of returned products to be processed by each 3PRLP. A numerical example is also provided to illustrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method. The results from this example are analyzed by considering the effects of capacity and budget limitations on order quantities and several managerial insights are proposed. © 2021 ISEIS All rights reserved.",Fuzzy programming; Linear physical programming; Reverse logistics; Third-party reverse logistics providers,cost analysis; infrastructure; logistics; methodology; outsourcing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126286933

We then analyze how market-level data can help to evaluate the policies ex post using baseline statistics. This exploits the firm's optimal response to a policy. With a return policy, data on quantities, return frequencies, and market size are sufficient to always assess the directional change in consumer welfare, while aggregate quantities alone are sufficient with a mandatory cooling off period. We discuss robustness of the model predictions and ex-post assessment to a variety of modifications, and discuss the benefits of the approach for policy design. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Behavioral economics; Cooling-off; Equilibrium-based inference; Identification of nonstandard preferences; Projection bias,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108256901

In some jurisdictions, the previously tax-free online channel is now required to remit sales tax. Motivated by policy evolution and sales-tax practices, we build analytical models to study the effects of sales tax on multichannel strategies and social welfare (which is defined as the overall surplus minus the negative external impact). We find that retailers prefer the online-and-offline channel to others when the product value is low relative to the consumer channel preference. If the offline sales tax rate is sufficiently high, the offline channel may simply function as the showroom. We also explore the optimal sales tax rate(t) that can maximize social welfare. We recognize that sales tax not only directly affects social welfare by influencing the optimal price (and service) decisions in the supply chain, but also indirectly affects social welfare through retailers' channel choice. In particular, imposing an online sales tax for low value products on small retailers only to transfer revenue from the retailers to the government; it is ineffective in increasing social welfare. We advise governments to develop sales tax policies based on consideration of channel type, product category, and the fit between the channel and product. Whereas an online tax free or a uniform tax rate fits low value products, setting different tax rates for different channels can be admissible for high value products. Counterintuitively, we also find that consumer showrooming may increase social welfare, as it reduces product returns (and the corresponding environmental impacts). © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",e-commerce; game theory; multichannel; operations-marketing interface; public policy; retail operations,Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Sales; Supply chains; Offline channel; Online channels; Policy evolution; Product categories; Product returns; Product value; Retail operations; Social welfare; Taxation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089544967

The decisions of interest are the retailer's price for purchases and refund amount for returns. Our analysis provides managerial insight into how a retailer makes these decisions to mitigate return abuse. Including both forms of return abuse in a base model, we find that there is an interaction effect that meaningfully changes a retailer's optimal decisions and profit, from what would be observed if only opportunism was present. We also evaluate two innovative technology-enabled countermeasures designed to mitigate return abuse: customer profiling and product tracking. A customer profiling system identifies opportunistic customers by using their personal identification and transaction history. In contrast, a product tracking system identifies fraudulent returns by recording each transaction of a product through the use of unique identifiers. We develop prescriptive models for these technologies and investigate the value of making such investments. Our analyses demonstrate the conditions in which it is advantageous to adopt these technologies and when such investments should be avoided. We find that when a retailer is able to charge restocking fees, it is well equipped to mitigate opportunism and fraud with only its price and refund decisions. Hence, the value of consumer profiling and product tracking technologies is limited. However, when a retailer is constrained to offer a full refund due to market dynamics, employing these technologies may hold significant value. Our analysis details the determinants of value, model sensitivity, and comparisons between models. We also address how these countermeasures impact a retailer's profitability, demand structure, and decisions with respect to price and refund amount. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Opportunism; Retail fraud; Return abuse; Return policy,article; consumer attitude; fraud; human; investment; profit; protein fingerprinting,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091225591

A good RL program can lower manufacturing costs, establish a green supply chain, enhance customer satisfaction and provide a competitive advantage. However, reducing disruptions and increasing operational efficiency in the automobile RL requires implementing innovative technology to improve information flow and security. Thus, this manuscript aims to examine the hurdles in automobile RL activities and how they can be effectively tackled by blockchain technology (BCT). Merging BCT and RL provides the entire automobile industry a chance to generate value for its consumers through effective vehicle return policies, manufacturing cost reduction, maintenance records tracking, administration of vehicle information and a clear payment record of insurance contracts. Design/methodology/approach: This research is presented in three stages to accomplish the task. First, previous literature and experts' opinions are examined to highlight certain factors that are an aggravation to BCT implementation. Next, this study proposed an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) – decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) with Choquet integral framework for computing and analyzing the comparative results of factor interrelationships. Finally, the causal outline diagrams are plotted to determine the influence of factors on one another for BCT implementation in automobile RL. Findings: This study has categorized the barriers to BCT implementation into five major factors – operational and strategical, technical, knowledge and behavioral, financial and infrastructural, and government rules and regulations. The results revealed that disreputable technology, low-bearing capacity of IT systems and operational inefficiency are the most significant factors to be dealt with by automobile industry professionals for finer and enhanced RL processes utilizing BCT. The most noticeable advantage of BCT is its enormous amount of data, permitting automobile RL to develop client experience through real-time data insights. Practical implications: This study reveals several factors that are hindering the implementation of BCT in RL activities of the automobile industry. The results can assist experts and policymakers improve their existing decision-making systems while making an effort to implement BCT into the automobile industry's RL activities. Originality/value: Although there are several studies on the benefits of BCT in RL and the adoption of BCT in the automobile industry, individually, none have explicated the use of BCT in automobile RL. This is also the first kind of study that has used IVIFS-DEMATEL with the Choquet integral framework for computing and analyzing the comparative results of factor interrelationships hindering BCT implementation in automobile RL activities. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Automobile industry; Blockchain technology; Distributed ledger; Industry 4.0; Reverse logistics; Supply chain management,,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85136074643

It is of great significance to study the dynamic controllability of this process. In this work, the dynamic control structures of the non heat-integration and full heat-integration azeotropic distillation are studied. The control ability of the proposed control structures is tested by adding flow disturbance and composition disturbance. For the non heat-integration scheme, the conventional PID control structure and composition controller is used to achieve effective control when a disturbance occurs. For the full heat-integration scheme, the temperature difference control scheme and the composition controller are used to handle disturbances. This control structure reduces the stabilization time and makes the purity of the product return to the set value. The effect of different makeup flow on the purity of acetonitrile under different disturbances is discussed. Moreover, two control strategies are synthetically analyzed and compared by calculating integral of squared error. Considering economy and controllability, it is concluded that control strategy of heat-integrated azeotropic distillation has more advantages. This study has certain guiding value for the research of chemical dynamic control. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Acetonitrile; Azeotropic distillation; Dynamic control; Heat-integration; Makeup,Controllers; Distillation; Integration; Three term control systems; Azeotropic distillation; Azeotropic distillation process; Control strategies; Control structure; Dynamic controllability; Dynamic controls; Economic advantages; Heat integration; Integration scheme; Makeup; Acetonitrile,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105802754

According to the 45th “Statistical Report on the Development of China′s Internet”, the number of online shopping users in China had reached 710 million by March 2020, accounting for 78. 6% of the total netizens. However, due to the separation of consumer purchases from consumer behavior in this shopping mode, consumers are not exposed to physical products. Instead, they form the initial perceived value by browsing the text, pictures, video introduction and product evaluation on the page, based on which a purchase decision is made. Moreover, only after receiving the actual product can they acquire the true information of the product such as material, quality and use experience. In most cases, it has a certain deviation in perception from the initial evaluation, which may degrade the final value evaluation. This uncertainty triggers the need for consumers to return the product that is found inapplicable after receiving it. In addition, when making purchase decisions, strategic consumers will comprehensively consider such factors as product prices and product availability based on the information obtained from various channels, and then generate rational expectations for future market conditions. The effects of purchases during the full price period and during the clearance period are compared, and the principle of maximizing self-revenue is utilized to choose the most favorable purchase timing. Under the stimulation of discounts, consumers often anticipate the current original-price products and future discount products separately. When consumers realize that they may regret their current choice in the future, i. e., the regret anticipation, their purchasing decisions will be affected. As a result, they often wait for buying products at a low price during the clearance period, which negatively influences both the shopping experience of consumers and the discount promotion strategy of online retailers. As consumer behavior becomes increasingly complicated, market demands and environments are facing more changes. In a market environment with great uncertainty, consumer behavior has become a necessary concern for online retailers in their decision-making process. Herein, this paper uses the rational expectations hypothesis to explore the impact of uncertainty of product value and anticipated regret on consumers′ purchase decisions. Then, based on the principle of maximizing profits, online retailer profit models are built under a return policy and non-return policy, respectively. Afterward, the optimal retail price, optimal order quantity, and optimal expected profit of online retailers under different policies are calculated and analyzed. Chapter One divides strategic consumers into two types: (1) rational consumers: when making purchase decisions, they only consider the economic utility of products under uncertain value; (2) emotional consumers: when making purchase decisions, they are affected by the economic utility of the product under the uncertain value, the anticipated regret. Such regret can be further classified into two conditions, high-price and out-of-stock. In the first case, consumers who purchase in the full price period may regret missing the price reduction activity; in the second case, consumers who may experience stock-out in the clearance period regret that they did not buy in the full price period. Notably, these two types of regret pose different influences on emotional consumers. In Chapter Two, under the non-return policy and the return policy, the reserved prices of rational consumers and emotional consumers are respectively obtained and compared according to the probability of products satisfying consumer needs (product matching rate). On this basis, high and low-value consumers are distinguished to formulate the market coverage strategy of online retailers. With the rational expectations hypothesis, Chapter Three analyzes the equilibrium problem between retailers and strategic consumers. Given the impact of the product value uncertainty and anticipated regret on consumer purchase decisions, the profit models of online retailers under the return policy and the non-return policy are constructed respectively. Afterward, the optimal retail price, the optimal order quantity and the optimal expectation of online retailers under different strategies and market coverage are calculated and discussed. As an extension, consumers′ opportunistic behavior is additionally considered, that is, purchasing and returning products at full price and purchasing again during the clearance period. It is found that the unconditional return policies of online retailers will reduce their profits in face of consumers′ opportunistic behavior. From the above research conclusion, the following management insights are obtained: (1) With the advancement of network information technology and the development of e-commerce, online retailers must consider consumers′ strategic purchasing behavior, as well as the impact of product value uncertainty and anticipated regret; otherwise, they may suffer profit reduction. (2) These retailers should consider the impact of product matching rates and the proportion of highvalue consumers when making decisions on return strategies. (3) Active implementation of a return policy is needed to stimulate strategic consumers to purchase ahead of time, thereby relieving the adverse impact of uncertain value and anticipated regret on retailer performance. (4) When consumers have opportunistic behavior, the return strategy may further reduce the profit of retailers, which requires them to adopt a conditional return policy © 2022, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.

First, consumers exhibit a prestige-seeking (snobbish) behavior that values product exclusivity. Their utility decreases as more consumers possess the product. Second, consumers show a forward-looking (strategic) behavior. They make shop visit decisions based on predicted product availability. Third, the manufacturer's production policy is unobservable to consumers. Given these basic premises, we consider a traditional newsvendor inventory system and analytically derive the equilibrium production and pricing strategies within the rational expectation framework. We then propose two improvement strategies, each using a well-established channel policy, to steer the game participants to reach a better equilibrium than the one for the traditional system. First, under the limited edition strategy with consumer returns, the firm uses the consumer return policy as a proxy for the limited edition strategy that aims to increase product exclusivity. Second, under the product line extension strategy, the firm applies product line extension as a means to guide the game participants to simultaneously increase product availability and product exclusivity. Finally, we extend the study by incorporating a variety of modeling variations and examine robustness of the research findings. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",consumption externality; operations strategies; snobs; strategic consumers,Costs; Manufacture; Consumer return policies; Improvement strategies; Operations strategies; Optimal production; Product availability; Product line extensions; Rational expectations; Traditional systems; Consumer behavior,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093849125

Consistent with omission theory, we find that prefilled returns lower compliance compared to self-completed returns when the prefilled returns do not estimate undocumented income (e.g., cash tips). However, the results show that including estimates of undocumented income increases taxpayer compliance relative to self-completed returns. We also find evidence suggesting that prefilled returns eliminate the often-replicated differences in reporting behavior between taxpayers in refund versus tax due settlement positions, suggesting that prefilled returns change individuals’ reference points. These findings suggest the implementation of a prefilled return policy could have economically important effects on taxpayer decisions. © 2021, American Accounting Association.

Our findings show that offering refurbishment for returned products can increase the retailer's order quantity and improve the capital-constrained supply chain performance. Moreover, the supplier strategically designs the wholesale price to hinder the retailer refurbishing returned products although the retailer always chooses to provide refurbishment under trade credit. When only trade credit financing is available, there exists a Pareto improvement on both partners' profits under certain cases. In addition, we investigate the financing preferences of the supply chain and find that product returns have a significant influence on the unique financing equilibrium.

The more products are returned, the more plastics are used. Existing research indicates that the plastic packages can contribute to the micro-plastics pollution of the environment. As consumer environmental awareness (CEA) improves, more and more consumers are willing to pay extra fees to change the materials of packages from plastics to others in order to protect the environment, prompting enterprises to adjust to their return policies. In this context, this paper takes environmental quality improvement effort and the environmental coefficient as decision variables, and compares the manufacturer’s optimal decisions under with and without return policy. Our results show as follows: (1) There is a positive correlation between CEA and environmental quality improvement effort and the environmental coefficient; that is, environmental quality improvement effort and the environmental coefficient increase with an increase in CEA; (2) When CEA is high (k ≤ τ ≤ d), there is a threshold for manufacturers to invest in environmental effort. However, when CEA is low (0 ≤ τ ≤ k), regardless of the return policy the manufacturer implements, its profit increases with the promotion of CEA, and when the manufacturer allows consumer returns, the relationship is more obvious; (3) The manufacturer should adopt an appropriate return policy according to the changes in CEA. When CEA is low (0 ≤ τ ≤ k), the manufacturer should adopt a without return policy; when CEA is high (k ≤ τ ≤ d), the manufacturer should adopt a full refund (r = p) return policy, which is the optimal profit, and increase investment in environmental protection. From the above conclusions, we suggest that the government should increase the publicity of environmental protection, consumers should establish the awareness of green consumption, and enterprises should increase investment in environmental quality improvement to achieve sustainable development. © 2021 by the authors.

The piece-wise returns-and-reordering process incurs excessive buffering and unwanted logistics costs which raises overall fulfillment charges. The objective of this study is to re-design e-retail distribution policy by providing temporal storage at logistics service provides' (LSP) location. The impact of recurrent returns on pricing and profit margins are also investigated over time continuum. Design/methodology/approach: A framework is developed to reduce the non-value added (NVA) storage and distribution efforts by providing collaborative buffering between LSP and e-retailer. The knapsack based buffering approach is tested and compared with traditional e-retail distribution practices. The revenue sharing concept is mathematically modelled and implemented in GAMS, which finally validated through multiple return scenarios. Findings: The proposed model outperforms the existing one under all scenarios with different configuration settings of re-ordering, profit margins, and buffer time windows. The distribution cost is found, linearly related to the necessary product buffering space. The findings help to re-design sustainable return policies for individual products so that maximum customer value can be yield with minimum costs. Research limitations/implications: This study helps to determine the NVA efforts incurred while storing and delivering multi-time returned products to ensure desired service levels. The revenue sharing model provides pricing strategies for e-retail practitioners deciding which product should store in what quantity for how much time at the shipping agency location so that it fulfils the re-ordering at least waiting and sufficient buffering. Originality/value: The proposed model extends the role of LPSs as temporary buffer providers to reduce returns-and-reordering fulfilment efforts in the e-retail network. This Collaborative framework offers an opportunity to amend the distribution contracts and policies time by time that enhances e-retailer's performance and customer satisfaction. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Customer service level; Distribution strategy; e-retail logistics; Lean buffer design; Product returns,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103180431

As a result, the past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of seller-initiated misrepresentation of quality through fake reviews, fake sales, and fake posts. We develop an analytical model to investigate sellers’ competition in quality misrepresentation in agency pricing and the platform’s policies. The platform can discourage sellers’ quality misrepresentations by increasing the cost of misrepresentation or implementing a more lenient product return policy. We find that while a stricter anti-misrepresentation policy deters the misrepresentation of the high-quality seller, such a strategy may unintendedly incentivize the low-quality seller to misrepresent the quality more.

Online distributors can offer generous policies to attract more customers, but at the cost of reducing total profits. In this paper, the effect of the pricing and quality of complementary products (products sold together with other items) in online selling under the return policy is investigated. For this purpose, a mathematical model is developed to obtain optimal values for selling price, refund amount, and quality of products. Based on analytical results, a solution algorithm is proposed to solve the numerical examples and perform sensitivity analysis. Findings reveal that, while increasing the sensitivity of demand with respect to the refund amount, the price, quality, and refund on returned products should be increased. In addition, the online distributor should increase the quality of products when customers are more sensitive to the quality of products. Among other results, the selling price is shown to be negatively affected by demand elasticity with respect to price. In this situation, the online distributor should reduce the quality level and the refund amount for returned products to avoid a sharp decline in profit. In addition, when the quality cost is high, the price and quality should be decreased and the refund amount unchanged. © 2021 by the authors.

It offers significant economic benefits to remanufacturers as well as providing enormous environmental and social benefits. However, achieving remanufacturing is complex and uncertain due to varying product return quantity and quality. These uncertainties call for proper assessment of returned Eol products to extract the most value from them. The evaluation involves inspecting the Eol products on arrival for remanufacturing, thereby making the most appropriate Eol decisions. These decisions are made by expert personnel by visually assess these products manually or using semi-automated techniques. However, the accuracy of these decisions is subjective, time-consuming, and prone to missing defects. The need to develop processes and tools for efficient, reliable, and repeatable inspection in remanufacturing becomes inevitable. Automated inspection becomes handy to improve the assessment of these defects as well as saving time. This paper proposes design-for-inspection as a tool to enhance remanufacturing. A discrete event simulation of this model for the torque converter remanufacturing process is presented and highlights the benefits of automating the remanufacturing inspection process. It further suggests the design improvements to obtain an enhanced automated inspection. © 2021 The Authors",Automated inspection; Design for inspection; Inspection; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing inspection,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116033779

This article will examine the role of temporariness within return migration including the imagining of return, decision-making for return, return visits, and return and reintegration experiences. The role of temporariness will be demonstrated through the experiences of three different types of return migrants: assisted voluntary returnees (AVR) in Albania, participants of an IOM temporary return programme for knowledge transfer in Afghanistan and returning domestic workers and female professionals experiences of temporariness in return in Ethiopia. Returnees in Albania experience ‘imposed temporariness’ through the AVR programme, which limits their stay in the intended destination country; participants in the return programme experience ‘regulated temporariness’ as the duration of their return is regulated by the programme and cannot exceed three months, and the professional returnees to Ethiopia experience ‘flexible temporariness’ as they have the freedom to circulate between Ethiopia and their country of new citizenship. Finally, the domestic worker returnees to Ethiopia cross-sect these categories depending on the nature of their return.

Companies and researchers typically favor and employ one of three methods to calculate the RR: based on the number of returned items, these items’ revenue, or their profit contribution. Interviews with 24 managers and industry experts reveal that two methods, item-based and revenue-based, are often used. However, little is known about how much the interpretation of RRs depends on the calculation method. In this article, the authors rely on extensive datasets to investigate these potential differences empirically. Analyzing more than 8 million transactions at sixteen different retailers, the authors find that RRs calculated via the three methods differ on average by 24.3%. The size of these differences makes cross-sectional comparisons of RRs calculated via different methods difficult. In contrast, the authors find that the developments of the RRs over time are similar, which allows for a meaningful time-series comparison of RR developments, regardless of the method. Finally, this research shows that all three calculation methods result in RRs that are equally insightful (leading) indicators of relevant retailer performance metrics. © 2021 New York University",Electronic commerce; Marketing metrics; Product return rate; Product returns; Retailing,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105559376

To reduce the uncertainty of the timing, quality and quantity of product returns in remanufacturing, motivated by the selling and leasing of electric vehicle batteries, we consider a monopolist vendor who markets her products by adopting two models: (1) a single leasing model, and (2) a single selling model. We first investigate the firm’s marketing model with remanufacturing and analyze the impact of the quality level of the returned products on the firm’s marketing and remarketing models. Then we compare selling and leasing models. We first find that only when the quality level of returned sold products is relatively high will the vendor choose to remanufacture under the single selling model. Conversely, only when the quality level of returned leased products is relatively low will the vendor decide to remanufacture under the single leasing model. Secondly, we show that the space of remanufacturable quality level under the single selling model is bigger than the space under the single leasing model. Thirdly, selling is more profitable than leasing when the quality level of returned sold products is sufficiently high. These results are further demonstrated by a numerical study. Our study provides firms with guidance on how to optimally adopt remanufacturing and marketing strategies that take into account the quality level of the returned products. © 2021",electric vehicle battery; leasing; quality level; remanufacturing; Selling,Commerce; Electric vehicles; Electric vehicle batteries; Marketing models; Marketing strategy; Operations management; Process uncertainties; Product returns; Quality levels; Remanufactured products; Sales,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101561419

At present, the omni-channel mode has become the development trend of the retail industry. In practice, due to the rapid change of market trends, offline retailers are often difficult to precisely forecast the market demand and thus face the problem of stock-out. Meanwhile, the manufacturers′ online direct channels are often confronted with high return risks due to the lack of physical experience. Thus, some manufacturers have begun to cooperate with their offline retailers to realize omni-channel operations. For example, Inman (a well-known clothing brand in China) cooperates with its offline retailer, in which the latter display in its store an exhibit with the same attributes as the product sold online, and then guide consumers faced with stock-out to experience the exhibit offline and then purchase online. Under this scenario, when the store is out of stock, consumers can first check whether the product matches their needs by experiencing the exhibit offline, and then go online to make a purchase, which would decrease online product returns. Thus, the manufacturer′s profit loss caused by product returns can be reduced. Moreover, the retailer can also obtain revenues that guide consumers to experience the exhibit offline and then purchase online. However, the revenues paid to the retailer increase the operating cost of the manufacturer, and may change the retailer′s order quantity, which in turn affects the manufacturer′s profit gain generated from the wholesale price. Thus, our paper investigates how a manufacturer should cooperate with its offline retailer through the “experience offline and buy online” strategy (O2O mode). This is important for supply chain members to satisfy consumers′ product experience needs and solve the problem of offline stock-out and then improve the efficiency of the whole supply chain. Under such background, we focus on a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer with a direct online channel and an offline retailer, and study the optimal O2O cooperation strategy between the manufacturer and the retailer. First, using consumer utility theory, we characterize the impacts of product fit probability and offline inventory level on the demand of different channels, after which we construct game-theoretical models under the cases of non-O2O cooperation and O2O cooperation, respectively. Second, we explore the impacts of O2O cooperation on the manufacturer and the retailer, compare the optimal wholesale price and inventory decisions before and after O2O cooperation, and discuss whether the O2O cooperation can weaken the manufacturer′s online return risk or reduce the retailer′s stock-out loss. Then, we obtain the equilibrium O2O cooperation strategy for supply chain members by comparing the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer under different O2O cooperation cases. We also discuss the improvement of the O2O cooperation strategy from the perspective of the whole supply chain. Finally, we use numerical examples to analyze the impacts of some critical parameters, such as the return handling cost and the product fit probability, on the O2O cooperation strategy of the supply chain. Our findings reveal that O2O cooperation affects the profit of the manufacturer from two aspects. On the one hand, O2O cooperation provides consumers with a better product experience, thereby reducing the manufacturer′s online return cost. On the other hand, the commission paid by the manufacturer under O2O cooperation will reduce the order quantity of the retailer, thus decreasing the manufacturer′s wholesale revenue. Similarly, O2O cooperation also has two-aspect effects on the profit of the retailer. One is that the commission paid by the manufacturer in O2O cooperation increases its profit, and the other is that O2O cooperation may cause the manufacturer to raise the wholesale price, thus reducing the retailer′s marginal profit. Whether O2O cooperation can bring positive revenue to the manufacturer or the retailer depends on the abovementioned factors. When the product fit probability is relatively low and the return handling cost is at a middle level, both the manufacturer and the retailer can benefit from O2O cooperation and thus agree to cooperate voluntarily. However, when the product fit probability is relatively low and the return handling cost is relatively high, the retailer becomes reluctant to engage in O2O cooperation. When both the product fit probability and the return handling cost are relatively low, or if the product fit probability is sufficiently high, the manufacturer becomes reluctant to engage in O2O cooperation. At this time, the manufacturer can design a transfer payment contract based on a bargaining game to promote O2O cooperation with the retailer and leads to a win-win situation for all supply chain members. Finally, compared with the case of non-O2O cooperation, the manufacturer should increase or decrease the wholesale price in O2O cooperation according to return handling cost and product fit probability, while the retailer should always reduce the order quantity no matter how the manufacturer′s wholesale price changes © 2022, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.",Cooperation strategy; Offline to online; Omni-channel; Supply chain,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85130339861

This study finds that a return policy with different attributes results in differing consumer moral recognition, moral judgment, moral intensity, and intentions toward fraudulent return. Among these constructs, evidence of a strong correlation between moral judgment and unethical returning behaviors was found. Social consensus has a greater impact on moral recognition, moral judgment, and fraudulent return intention than on the magnitude of consequences and probability of effect.

Using order-level data from an online fashion retailer in Sweden, we investigate the introduction of free returns for customers in Denmark starting November 1, 2017, but not for customers in Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Germany, and the rest of Europe (the control group). Using difference-in-differences, with and without sample matching, the introduction of free returns increased the order bill by 54.95 Swedish Krona (SEK) (9.15%), product variety per order by 0.057 (8.74%), gross margin per order by 29.90 SEK (9.71%), and returns by 0.195 items per order (7.86%). This likelihood of increased returns was generally similar across different product categories. The findings are robust to parallel trends, event studies, placebo effects, alternative control groups (with Scandinavian countries, Sweden and Norway), country-time trends, and correlations between outcome variables. Based on back-of-the-envelope calculations, the cost of offering free returns is greater than the increase in gross profit driven by free returns. Though our results show that free returns may not be of short-term benefit, retailers must also consider the long-term strategic implications of free returns. © 2021 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",customer behavior; free returns; online retailing; return policy,Electronic commerce; Control groups; Customer behavior; Denmark; Economic values; Free return; On-line fashion; Online retailing; Re-turn-on; Return policy; Swedishs; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101845631

This assumption shapes court decisions over asylum cases and is factored in assistance packages upon return. It is assumed that social networks will act as a “safety net” for returnee. However, recent evidence on post-return outcomes shows that migrants’ social networks may not provide them with the resources they need to reintegrate their country of origin. While the role of social networks in destination contexts has been extensively studied, this article shows that social networks may not act as facilitators of reintegration, but as barriers to this process. Taking the case study of returns from Europe to Afghanistan, the article concludes on the weak ties and broken bond between individual returnees and communities, further speaking of a process of community dislocation upon return. Policy and practice need to unpack the concept of “community of return” as a community may simply not exist, have changed or be unable to act as a source of support for returnees from Europe. © 2020 The Authors.

There are two types of RSI, namely free RSI (f-RSI), under which the retailer covers the RSI premium, and for-a-fee RSI (faf-RSI), under which consumers pay the premium. We study the optimal f-RSI and faf-RSI strategies for a monopolistic online retailer as well as the impact RSI on the retailer's returns policy. First, we find that RSI is complementary to the partial-refund returns policy as it further increases the retailer's profit. Specifically, the retailer adopts the RSI strategy if and only if the RSI premium is relatively small; in addition, the RSI strategy is more appealing with a higher RSI compensation and product salvage value, and a smaller return shipping cost. Second, we find that under the f-RSI strategy, the retailer does not change its refund price, i.e., the refund amount equals the product salvage value; while, under the faf-RSI strategy, the retailer changes its refund price strategically according to the RSI premium, compensation, and number of RSI-sensitive consumers. Third, we find that the f-RSI strategy dominates the faf-RSI strategy from the profit and social welfare perspectives; whereas, the faf-RSI may lead to a “win-win” situation for the retailer and consumers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Free or for-a-fee; Game theory; Online retailing; Return policy; Return shipping insurance,Electronic commerce; Profitability; Sales; Ships; Free or for-a-fee; Insurance premiums; Monopolistics; Online consumers; Online platforms; Online retailing; Return policy; Return shipping insurance; Shipping cost; Social welfare; Game theory,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103658905

Although, in some cases, these strategies may prove profitable and satisfactory for both the consumer and e-tailer, in other cases, the e-impulsivity of the consumer creates undesired business consequences, such as consumer regret and product returns for refund. Therefore, there are some circumstances under which impulse e-buying should be prevented for the mutual benefit of the consumer and e-tailer. Impulse buying has been explained as a failure in the management of consumer self-control, together with the influence of contextual variables that lead to unplanned or impulsive buying. Therefore, a person with a tendency to impulsivity and faced with certain external and internal stimuli in the internet environment, is more likely to buy impulsively than one without this personality trait. This research aims to investigate whether, in the face of undesired impulse e-buying, it is possible to manage the consumer impulsivity through gamified strategies reducing the probability of future returns and thus, to avoid the feeling of shame, guilt, and post-purchase remorse at the customer level and the economic cost at the company level. An experiment was set, in an online shopping context, designed ad-hoc. A purchase scenario was simulated. One hundred-sixteen (116) Americans ages 18-35 years old participated in the study for a financial incentive and were contacted through MTurk. Our results show that gamification approaches may help consumers reevaluate their decisions and retract them, thus reducing the volume of product returns resulting from impulse e-behavior. As managerial implications, in industries where impulse e-buying provokes high volumes of product returns, it will be appropriate for e-tailers to help consumers make timely and better decisions, in turn reducing the cost of reverse logistics and promoting consumer satisfaction with their brands. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Gamification; Impulse buying; Nudge theory; Product returns,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133339543

In practice, major retailers adopt BORS and BOPS both individually and jointly, which motivates us to explore when it is profitable for a retailer to adopt BORS or/and BOPS strategy. We formulate a stylised model that captures (1) consumers' uncertainty about product match, (2) the offline search cost for consumers, and (3) the cross-selling effect of the consumers' store visit. We find that the cross-selling benefit and the offline search cost have a significant impact on the retailer's optimal omnichannel strategy. When the cross-selling benefit is sufficiently low, adopting BORS alone is optimal for the retailer. When the cross-selling benefit is moderate and the offline search cost is high, adopting both strategies has a complementary effect, and it is optimal for the retailer to adopt both omnichannel strategies jointly. However, when the cross-selling benefit is sufficiently high, adopting both strategies could be less profitable to the retailer than adopting the BOPS strategy alone. Moreover, consumer surplus may decrease in this case, suggesting that adopting both omnichannel strategies could result in a lose-lose situation for both the retailer and the consumers. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",buy online and pick up in store; buy online and return in store; Omnichannel strategies; product returns; strategic consumer behaviour,Pickups; Profitability; Buy online and pick up in store; Buy online and return in store; Cross-selling; Offline; Omnichannel strategy; Order fulfillment; Product returns; Search costs; Strategic consumer behaviors; Uncertainty; Sales,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133349846

Bearing titles like ‘assisted voluntary return and reintegration’ (AVRR), they are often rationalized as a more humane alternative to forced deportation. Critics question their voluntariness, suggesting they are actually an extension of the deportation apparatus. While broadly sympathetic to these criticisms, this paper offers a novel perspective on AVRR. We argue AVRR is reshaping what we call the political imaginary of deportation. Focusing on the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a leading architect of AVRR, we insist scholars take seriously the visual images and narratives through which voluntary return is discursively constructed. First, we discuss the political imaginary, and clarify what this concept brings to deportation studies. Second, we present a mapping of the political imaginary of deportation as this appears within IOM information campaigns concerning AVRR. We organize this material i­n terms of three analytics: returnees as activists, return journeys as homecoming, and deportation as self-reinvention.

It is critical for the retailer to manage returns by choosing appropriate returns policies for the two periods. This paper examines the retailer's customer returns policy strategy, and pricing and ordering decisions, in a supply chain selling seasonal products over two periods. The manufacturer is a Stackelberg pricing leader and sets wholesale prices at the beginning of each period. The retailer may carry over both returns and strategic inventory of new products from the regular period to the markdown period; we show that if the holding cost on new products is low it carries over strategic inventory; it also carries returns to the markdown period, if it offers a Money-Back Guarantee in the regular period. Interestingly, we find that customer returns can serve as a substitute for inventory, and the retailer is less likely to carry strategic inventory from the first period to the second when it offers an MBG returns policy, as compared to when it offers a no-refund policy. We also show that an MBG returns policy is not always a dominant returns strategy for the retailer, if it has the option to carry strategic inventory. We identify the conditions under which either a no-refund policy or an MBG over two periods can lead to a Pareto improvement for both the retailer and the manufacturer. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Customer returns strategy; Pricing; Stackelberg game; Strategic inventory,Costs; Manufacture; Supply chains; Customer returns policies; Optimal decisions; Pareto improvements; Refund policies; Regular periods; Returns policies; Seasonal product; Whole sale prices; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090850914

For this reason, manufacturers and retailers need to consider operational challenges for manage-ment of product returns. A consumer product return in “shopping” is the procedure of a customer bringing previously bought products to the retailer and getting a payment in the original payment option, an exchange for a similar or different item, or a shop credit in retail. Defective products brought to the stores for return by the customers are received by the stores and put into the review process, which takes several weeks. As a result of this examination, it is understood whether the malfunction is a user error or not. Machine learning algorithms serve to ease the burden in return operations and increase efficiency. Intelligent decision-making mechanisms, organizations will decide whether the product return should be accepted, or not by comparing attributes such as historical return data of the products, supplier information, quality of raw materials like leather or artificial leather, seasonal conditions, consumer behaviors. Boosting algorithms are commonly used for resolving binary classification issues. This study aims to present a real case study that is conducted in FLO, which is one of the biggest shoe producer and retailer in Turkey to improve decision making processes of shoe returns using customer and product data via machine learning algorithms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Artificial intelligence; Customer loyalty; Machine learning; Product return,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135021317

However, the implementation of green supply chain management strategies has lots of different risks. The main contribution of this research is to evaluate and rank the companies in the tire industry with an emphasis on the environmental risks of the sustainable supply chain using the hybrid best-worst method (BWM) and fuzzy VIKOR (FVIKOR). First, data analysis was implemented by applying the BWM technique, which has higher reliability than other similar techniques. Next, the importance of the indicators involved in the risk of the green supply chain, including operational, supply, product return, financial, demand, organizational, and government, was calculated. Finally, according to the calculated weights for each criterion, five active companies in the tire industry were ranked using the FVIKOR technique. The results of prioritizing criteria and subcriteria showed that ""financial risks""are the most important indicator among the indicators involved in green supply chain risk. Among the subcriteria, ""rates related to inflation and currency""from the cluster of financial risks were recognized as the most important subcriteria. Moreover, the results of the ranking of five companies in the tire industry indicated that Dana Company is in the best situation in terms of green supply chain risks. Finally, a series of practical suggestions for managers and a series of scientific suggestions for future research have been presented.  © 2022 Mahmonir Bayanati et al.",,Behavioral research; Environmental protection; Finance; Reliability analysis; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Tires; BAD methods; Environmental issues; Financial risks; Fuzzy VIKOR; Green supply chain; Multicriteria decision making methods; Supply chain innovations; Supply-chain risks; Sustainable supply chains; Tyre industry; Decision making,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140009689

Distributed lag model has been proposed in recent years to forecast used product returns based on past sales data. However, the forecasting accuracy of a distributed lag model is affected to a large extent by the estimation of the parameters of the lag function. The Bayesian inference approach for parameter estimation which has been proposed by previous studies requires solving the marginal likelihood function which is often difficult even for a slightly complex lag function. In this research, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Bayesian inference approach is proposed to estimate the parameters of a lag function which provides an efficient way to sample parameter values from a posterior distribution regardless of the complexity of a lag function. An example case study of forecasting used product returns was undertaken to illustrate the proposed parameter estimation approach which was validated by comparing it with the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) method. The validation results show that the forecasting accuracy of the number of used product returns based on the parameters estimated by using the proposed MCMC based Bayesian approach is better than that estimated by using the MLE method in terms of mean absolute percent errors and variance of errors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Bayesian inference; Forecasting, product returns; Markov-chain Monte-Carlo; Remanufacturing; Uncertainty",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099072270

Cooperative-return-to-store (CRS), where an e-tailer&#x0027;s merchandise can be returned to another retailer&#x0027;s stores, seems to provide a panacea for e-tailers to improve return flexibility and save on return handling costs. However, current practices indicate that only a limited number of e-tailers offer an in-store return option through CRS. This article elucidates the intuition behind this phenomenon by analyzing two asymmetric competing e-tailers&#x2019; decisions on whether to participate in CRS with a third-party offline retailer who establishes a drop-off convenience level. Perhaps counterintuitively, we find that CRS&#x0027;s return service improvement and cost reduction for e-tailers can deter them from participating in the cooperation under certain conditions. Our analysis also demonstrates that the offline retailer could improve performance by strategically adjusting the CRS program&#x0027;s main appeal (e.g., return service improvement or cost reduction) to the e-tailers based on their product differentiation.

Many retailers and academics are oblivious to the nature and scale of this challenge. Interdisciplinary research is needed to develop supporting theory, and cross-functional teams are required to implement measures addressing economic, ecological and social sustainability issues. Design/methodology/approach: The initial project adopted a multi-case study approach, whereby returns processes were mapped, vulnerabilities identified and a returns cost calculator was developed. Findings: Product returns processes are usually complicated, prone to internal and external fraud, inefficient and lack sustainability. They can generate considerable losses to the business, especially as returns data are often not systematically collected, monitored or reported to senior management. There are important implications for strategic and operational management, namely the need to develop a concept for Lean returns systems. Originality/value: Product returns are a unique and understudied but growing field in academic research, with only few publications over the last two decades. Yet the phenomenon is causing increasing problems in business and society. Robust solutions could achieve great financial and non-financial impacts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business strategy; Operations strategy; Retail sector; Reverse logistics; Supply chain management; Sustainability,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086179212

To assure product quality and to enhance customer proclivity in such environments, post-sale services (i.e., product returns, exchange, and maintenance) may be considered to alleviate customers’ skepticism. Therefore, this study’s objective is to investigate the role of an online retailer’s post-sale services (i.e., product return, exchange, and maintenance) on customers’ attitudinal (building relationships) and behavioral aspects (developing customers’ repurchase intentions). Structural equation modeling is applied to data collected through an online survey answered by 409 online customers of jd.com (after missing data were removed). Research findings show that product return, exchange, and maintenance services are strongly predictive of online customer satisfaction, and satisfaction significantly impacts customer trust. Both customer satisfaction and trust, as indicators of relationship quality, further mediate the links between product return, exchange, and maintenance services and online customer repurchase intention. In addition, differences between male and female customers were found in various aspects of online retailers’ product return, exchange, and maintenance services. This is the first empirical study that not only examines the influence of all three dimensions of online retailers’ post-sale services on customers’ online shopping perceptions and decisions, but also considers differences between male and female customers. Finally, this research provides theoretical and managerial implications based on conceptual and empirical evidence. © Copyright © 2020 Javed, Wu, Qadeer, Manzoor, Nadeem and Shouse.",customer satisfaction; product exchange; product maintenance; product return; repurchase intention; trust,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099142440

For the case with no return freight cost, we find that the optimal sale price and refund depend on the heterogeneity of consumers and the proportion of high-value consumers. When consumer heterogeneity is relatively high and the proportion of high-value consumers is very high, the retailer should not adopt the return policy; otherwise, the retailer should adopt it. For the case with a positive return freight cost, the retailer has to set a higher refund or a lower price, hurting its profit. When consumer heterogeneity is relatively high and the proportion of high-value consumers is very high, the optimal price is unchanged, but the optimal refund increases. In other situations, the retailer needs to reduce the price or increase the refund to attract consumers. Further considering the case where the retailer provides return freight insurance for the consumers, we find that whether freight insurance benefits the retailer depends on the unit insurance premium and the return freight cost. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Consumer return policy; e-commerce; Freight insurance; Heterogeneous consumers; Pricing,Insurance; Sales; Freight costs; Insurance premiums; Optimal pricing; Product value; Return policy; Sale price; Costs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083739928

The research process included the development of research tools such as questionnaires. Anonymous surveys were conducted by computer assisted web interview among individual customers from Poland on a sample 327 respondents. Non-stratified random sampling was used, as we considered it to be the most effective in terms of the effort-benefit ratio of the survey. A contingency table was constructed from the responses, the observed values and expected values were compared, and the Pearson Chi-square and the p-value of Fisher’s exact test were calculated. The research process carried out as well as the analysis of the obtained results allowed us to respond to the research questions. As a result, it can be stated that the clients, both satisfied (80.1%) and dissatisfied (84,4%), tended to share their opinion about return experience with other potential clients. Moreover, 42.2% of the respondents declared that they would not buy again from a seller after an unsuccessful return operation. The presented conclusions enrich the theoretical understanding of customer behavior and their purchase intention. It also offers retailers a quantitative benchmark and new perspective on the design of return policy in order to improve customer satisfaction. © 2021 by the authors.

To this end, a decision framework is proposed based on a multi-criteria decision structure that incorporates AHP into VIKOR under Intuitionistic Fuzzy Theory. This integration presents different solutions and rankings based on different decision-making strategies and also captures uncertainty in the evaluation process. While Intuitionistic Fuzzy AHP calculates the importance weights of the proposed criteria indicated as scalability, privacy, interoperability, audit, latency, visibility, trust, and security, Fuzzy VIKOR ranks the logistics operations demonstrated as materials handling, warehousing, order processing, transportation, packaging, fleet management, labeling, vehicle routing and product returns management. The proposed decision framework was applied in a large-scale logistics company located in Turkey. The findings of this study suggest that while the most important criteria are security, visibility and audit, the most feasible logistics operations proved to be transportation, materials handling, warehousing, order processing and fleet management in a possible blockchain implementation. The decision framework in this study may enable decision makers to evaluate the feasibility of blockchain in logistics operations, which is one of the main research gaps in the current blockchain research.

The retailer and the 3PRLP share the gains from coordination according to Nash bargaining, with threat points that depend on the wholesale and retail prices. The relationship between product returns and manufacturer price and profit depends on the feasibility of coordination, which depends on the rate of returns. For a range of rates, manufacturer profit is less under coordination than in the uncoordinated case despite coordination yielding overall efficiency gains. In this case, the manufacturer is unable to capture gains from downstream coordination.

Timely detection of such scams is difficult as they are fueled by an extensive suite of criminal services, such as credential theft, document forgery, and fake shipments. Ultimately, the scam enables malicious actors to steal arbitrary goods from merchants with minimal investment. In this paper, we perform in-depth manual and automated analysis of public and private messages from four large underground forums to identify the malicious actors involved in CAaaS, carefully study the operation of the scam, and define attributes to fingerprint the scam and inform mitigation strategies. Additionally, we surveyed users to evaluate their attitudes toward these mitigations and understand the factors that merchants should consider before implementing these strategies. We find that the scam is easy to scale-and can bypass traditional anti-fraud efforts-and thus poses a notable threat to online retailers. © 2021 by The USENIX Association.

This study aims to investigate the business-To-business repurchase intentions of Pakistan textile and clothing industry customers. The study framework specifically consolidates the mutual dynamics of appealing (service quality), facilitating (product returns), and averting (switching costs) factors altogether and the effect of these variables on customer satisfaction and thus on customer retention (repurchase intent) in the textile's transactional scenario.

The structural equational modeling technique was applied to examine the study hypotheses. The findings contended that service quality and switching costs are essential determinants that shape the repurchase intentions.

This article critically considers whether return sponsorships can work in practice. It identifies three challenges. First, the proposal's envisioned solidarity measures lack predictability and tangibility. Second, return sponsorships will create new vulnerabilities for those issued return orders. Third, the mechanism is informed by the improbable assumption that more conditionalities vis-à-vis third countries will substantially increase the EU's return rate. Overall, the Commission is taking a considerable risk.

To evaluate the resources and total efficiency of the proposed model to facilitate the allocation resource process, to increase resource efficiency and to improve the efficiency of disassembly centers by Inverse DEA. Design/methodology/approach: The design of a closed-loop logistics network for after-sales service for mobile phones and digital cameras has been developed by the mixed-integer linear programming method (MILP). Development of MILP method has been performed by simultaneously considering three main objectives including: total network profit, green supply chain factors (environmental sustainability) and maximizing the efficiency of disassembly centers. The proposed model of study is a six-level, multi-objective, single-period and multi-product that focuses on electrical waste. The efficiency of product return centers is calculated by SDEA method and the most efficient centers are selected. Findings: The results of using the model in a case mining showed that, due to the use of green factors in network design, environmental pollution and undesirable disposal of some electronic waste were reduced. Also, with the reduction of waste disposal, valuable materials entered the market cycle and the network profit increased.

Customers may return misfit products either to stores for a full refund or online as per the firm's return policy. We model prices to be identical across channels, allow crosschannel returns, and endogenize customers' purchase and return decisions, capturing typical features of an omnichannel setting. Our analysis helps explain why some omnichannel firms choose full refunds, whereas others charge a fee for online returns. We find that omnichannel firms with good salvage partners for online returns (e.g., Nordstrom) as well as those with more store-based customers (e.g., Macy's) should offer full refunds. Similarly, firms are incentivized to offer full refunds for products that customers are more likely to inspect in store (e.g., Express for footwear). In contrast, firms with a significant store network and better in-store salvage opportunities (e.g., J.C.

Design/methodology/approach: The data consisted of 21 semi-structured interviews (pilot study) and a quantitative survey (n = 384; main study) targeted at consumers who had bought fashion items online. Findings: Qualitative insights revealed that perceptions of the returning experience are driven by monetary costs, convenience, stress and guilt. Quantitative findings showed that the returning experience explains return satisfaction for both planned and unplanned returners, and returning satisfaction explains overall satisfaction and WOM. The noteworthy difference concerns loyalty: although customers that planned to return items are more loyal to the organization, it is the unplanned returners whose loyalty can be significantly increased by better managing the returning process. Practical implications: Returning products online is increasingly common and thus forms an important part of the customer's overall experience with an organization. Returns management can therefore drive key customer outcomes. Understanding the dynamics between the product return experience, return satisfaction and customer outcomes will help practitioners design and implement more informed returns management strategies. Measures are also presented that assess the cognitive and emotional aspects associated with returning products. Social implications: Returning products is an increasingly important challenge for online retailers. Understanding what kinds of returning behaviors occur allows companies to design and execute better informed decisions to manage this phenomenon, not only for the sake of firm performance but also for societal and environmental benefits – the triple bottom line. Originality/value: While scholars have investigated the relationship between return policies (e.g. free vs fee) and profitability, no prior literature has examined the returning experience: how consumers perceive the returning process; motivations for their returns (whether returns were planned or not) and subsequent customer outcomes. © 2021, Timo Rintamäki, Mark T.

We focus on functionality-based (complementarity and substitutability) and non-functionality-based associations between products. We hypothesize that complementarity of the products purchased together reduces return due to reduced product uncertainty, while substitutability increases return because of the potential signal of uncertainty. We further hypothesize that non-functionality association increases return because unplanned purchases might lead to the misfit between product quality and consumer needs. Analyzing the unique large-scale transaction data, we find that complementarity, substitutability, non-functionality association all increase returns. That is, products purchased with other related products in terms of functionality or demand are more likely to be returned. Additional analysis with interaction terms indicates that such effects can be contingent on customer or product characteristics. We discuss the cost implications for the online marketplaces. © ICIS 2020.

Specifically, the challenging issue, in the remanufacturing context, of quality control under the stochastic nature of product returns is addressed. Experiments are conducted to measure the effect of the return rate variability on the system performances. The main finding is that when this variability is low, the impact of return rate uncertainty on the system performances remains minor. Hence investing in the costly market-driven product acquisition approach may be useless for a company which is not confronted to high variability in product returns. However, results showed that, when this return rate variability increases the critical stock level and optimal quality control changed considerably. Consequently, for a company that experiences such variability, acquiring returned products through the classic waste stream system may result in considerable increase of the total production cost.  © 2021 IEEE.",Quality control; Remanufacturing; Return rate; Simulation modelling; Uncertainty,Optimization; Quality assurance; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Optimization models; Product returns; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing system; Return rate; Simulation-based optimizations; Simulation-modelling; Stochastic return; Systems performance; Uncertainty; Quality control,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125770651

Differing from the competition models in literature, a novel two-dimensional valuation structure is built, which considers the valuations of a consumer on two products and the valuation differentiation of all consumers on each product. We consider both monopoly and duopoly (competitive) markets. In each market, two models are respectively developed, one with and one without the return policies. We derive the solutions for the four models, and conduct some analytical and numerical investigations. The results show that return policy with a partial refund is always chosen by the sellers in both monopoly and duopoly markets. Return policy benefits the seller in a monopoly market, but may not benefit the sellers in a duopoly market. In the duopoly models, one seller can be considered as a monopoly seller who meets a new competitor. Our results show that the monopoly seller will reduce its price by no more than 20% when there comes a competitor, and, counter-intuitively, it will meanwhile adopt a severer return policy to the consumers . © 2021 by the authors.

Some consumers may thus experience overpurchase or underpurchase regret, depending on whether they have purchased a higher- or lower-quality level than what they would have chosen had they known their true valuations. When consumers anticipate their potential postpurchase regret, their purchase decisions may be affected. Our analysis shows that overpurchase regret lowers the firm's profit, but underpurchase regret can benefit the firm if consumers' overpurchase regret is not strong. When the firm optimally designs its product line, the quality difference between its offerings will be larger (smaller) if consumers' anticipated regret increases (reduces) its profit. Surprisingly, although anticipated regret tends to reduce consumers' utility, in equilibrium, the presence of anticipated regret can increase consumers' expected surplus. We further examine when the firm should allow consumers to return their products by paying a restocking fee and how the optimal restocking fee will change with consumers' propensities for the two types of regret. We also experimentally show that consumers' propensities of underpurchase and overpurchase regret are different and can be influenced by the firm's messages.  © 2020 INFORMS.",Anticipated regret; Behavioral economics; Price discrimination; Product line design; Product return,Profitability; Product line design; Product-lines; Purchase decision; Quality levels; Product design,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090067738

A return policy in the first period and the competition between the manufactured and the remanufactured products in the second period are jointly considered to develop the optimal production quantity strategies analytically and numerically. We find that if the two products are substitutable, the quantities of the new products manufactured in the first period and the remanufactured products produced in the second period are non-decreasing in the return policy, but the quantity of the manufactured products in the second period is decreasing in the return policy. In this case, the return rate determines the profit level, but the collection rate has little impact on the profit. If the two products are complementary, there is a critical value of the collection rate. When the collection rate is smaller than this value, the production quantities increase in the return policy; otherwise, they decrease in the return policy. In this scenario, the return policy and the collection rate mutually make a positive impact on the profit. Additionally, although a generous return policy is always profitable, it may lead to less production of manufactured and remanufactured products, especially when they are complementary. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Manufacturing management; Manufacturing strategy; Optimization; Production management; Remanufacturing,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060344951

This study explores this issue in the context of the theory of perceived risk (TPR), investigating return policy leniency and distribution channel choice as potential factors to foster remanufactured products' sales. Design/methodology/approach: This research utilizes an experimental design composed of a pre-test and a scenario-based main experiment to explore how return policy leniency might mitigate consumers' perceived risk and how their related purchase intention differs across two types of retail distribution channel structures (i.e. brick-and-mortar vs. online). Findings: The investigation into the efficacy of return policy leniency within two retail distribution channel settings (i.e. brick-and-mortar vs. online) illustrates that providing a lenient return policy is an effective “cue” in increasing consumer purchase intention for remanufactured products. While prior literature has established that consumers value return policy leniency for new products, the authors provide empirical evidence that this preference also applies to remanufactured products. Notably, that return policy preference holds true in both channel settings (i.e. brick-and-mortar vs. online) under consideration. Additionally, and contrary to the authors’ predictions, consumers perceived remanufactured products sold via both channel settings as equally risky, thus highlighting that both are appropriate distribution channels for remanufactured products. Finally, while research on new products provides some initial guidance on consumer perceptions of quality and risk, the study provides empirical evidence into the difference of perceived risk with regard to new versus remanufactured products. Originality/value: By employing the TPR, this research explored the role played by two supply chain management related factors (returns policy and channel structure) in reducing consumer's perceived risk and increasing purchase intention. In doing so, this study answers the call for more consumer-based supply chain management research in a controlled experimental research setting. © 2021, Ilenia Confente, Ivan Russo, Simone Peinkofer and Robert Frankel.",Channel; Experimental design; Remanufactured products; Return policy leniency; Theory of perceived risk,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103211151

A primary source of OM in soils is straw return, accounting for more than 65% of OM input. Straw-OM has long been believed to reduce metal bioaccumulation, e.g., by immobilizing metals in soils. However, there is growing evidence that straw return could possibly enhance bioavailability and thus risks (i.e., food safety) of some metals in crops, including Cd, Hg, and As. Poor understanding of straw return-induced increases in metal bioavailability would add uncertainty in assessing or mitigating risks of metals in contaminated farming soils. Here, 863 pieces of literature (2000–2019) that reported the effects of straw return on metal bioavailability and bioaccumulation were reviewed. Mechanisms responsible for the increased metal mobility and bioavailability under straw return are summarized, including the effects of dissolution, complexation, and methylation. Effects of straw return on the physiology and the absorption of metals in plants is also discussed (i.e., physiological effect). These mechanisms are then used to explain the observed increases in the mobility, bioavailability, and bioaccumulation of Cd, Hg, and As under straw amendment. Information summarized in this study highlights the importance to re-consider the current straw return policy, particularly in metal-contaminated farmlands. © 2020",Bioaccumulation; Food safety; Metal; Organic matter; Soil remediation; Straw return,"Agriculture; Biological Availability; Cadmium; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Pollution; Metals; Metals, Heavy; Soil; Soil Pollutants; arsenic; cadmium; mercury; metal; organic matter; cadmium; heavy metal; metal; agricultural soil; bioaccumulation; food safety; heavy metal; risk assessment; soil organic matter; soil remediation; straw; absorption; agricultural land; Article; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; chemical interaction; complex formation; crop; dissolution; food safety; methylation; risk assessment; soil analysis; soil pollution; agriculture; pollution; soil; soil pollutant",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090407932

This paper examines consignment with consumer non-defective returns behaviour, where the upstream vendor makes a contract with the downstream retailer. The vendor decides what the consignment and refund prices are, and the retailer chooses the retail price. The vendor gets paid based on the sold units, salvages and returns. We analyze two contracts, called retailer and vendor managed consignment inventory (RMCI and VMCI, respectively), the only difference being that under RMCI, the retailer chooses the service level, and under VMCI, the vendor specifies it. We present precise solutions to VMCI for additive uncertainty and compare them to the multiplicative case. We prove that the vendor’s optimal return policy depends on a salvage value since if it is equal to zero, the vendor should not offer the return policy. We show that the channel may gain profit from the return policy for the positive salvage value. We demonstrate that the form of uncertainty and the presence of consumer returns considerably affect the solutions to the problems. As an extension, we give the results obtained under RMCI. © 2020 Canadian Operational Research Society (CORS).",Additive uncertainty; Consignment contracts; Consumer returns; Price and inventory decision; Supply chain management,Additives; Inventory control; Consignment contracts; Precise solutions; Retail price; Return policy; Service levels; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101419473

The purpose of this study is to contribute to the body of knowledge for unattended grocery delivery services by empirically identifying and describing the forms and determinants of customer expectations. Design/methodology/approach: A multiple case study of potential early adopters was conducted to explore customer expectations of unattended grocery delivery services. Empirical data collected from direct observations and semi-structured interviews with ten Swedish households were coded and put through a single-case as well as a cross-case analysis revealing emerging patterns from which propositions were formed. Findings: The iteration of theory and data in the case study resulted in a conceptual model of service expectations and determinants, containing six propositions. The study reveals a clear pattern that consumers expect to save time, gain flexibility and benefit from the ease of use of the service, while they predict sufficient security. Moreover, consumers’ desire open access features from retailers and service providers, integrated product returns service and nondescript hardware designs. The findings suggest that these service expectations are determined by personal needs, technology literacy and situational factors. The identified personal needs are stress reduction, limiting social interaction and increasing spare time. Research limitations/implications: To support further theory development, this study presents six propositions for the types, forms and determinants of customer expectations of unattended grocery delivery. Practical implications: This study provides managers with up-to-date insights into customer expectations and offers guidance in designing and developing unattended grocery delivery services.

They engender preference inconsistencies and reversals in customers, which can lead to product returns. The aim of this study is to enable retailers to select the optimal cross-border logistics mode that fulfils their marketing strategies while taking product returns into consideration. We propose a novel way to describe customer utility by incorporating customer time preferences, and construct three cross-border logistics models. The theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that, if retailers want to eliminate or reduce their product return rates, they can adjust their delivery lead times in each logistics mode under various product procurement and sales prices, commodity tariffs, international and domestic postage and operating costs. In particular, the O2O mode is always a better option for retailers than the O2D mode, and under certain conditions, the D2D mode is better for retailers than the O2O mode. To increase market demand, the O2O mode is optimal for retailers selling high-priced products, while the O2D mode is optimal for retailers selling low-priced products. This study also provides suggestions for overseas manufacturers.

However, being environmentally responsible is a vital element in regard to reputation enhancement and passing legislative requirements. This paper investigates two competing closed-loop supply chains: 1) a retailer with an expensive but reliable domestic supplier and cheap but unreliable foreign supplier, 2) a competitor with its integrated supplier. The retailer and competitor compete based on the game theory approach to decide on prices and return policies and prices when the retailer confronts disruption risk by the foreign supplier. The reverse supply chain is addressed by asking the retailer and a competitor to collect used products for recycling purposes by suppliers. The suppliers decide on the value paid for each the used product collected by retailers. The results indicate that in the dual sourcing situation there is a direct correlation between supply from a foreign supplier, and the return rate of used products. Besides, the competitor and its integrated supplier have to use the return policy as leverage to revive the competitive market. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Closed-loop supply chain; Disruption risk; Game theory; Pricing and sourcing; Recycling,Costs; Game theory; Recycling; Sales; Closed-loop; Closed-loop supply chain; Disruption risk; Environmentally responsible; Foreign suppliers; Game-theoretic; Pricing and sourcing; Return policy; Supply disruption; Used product; Supply chains,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119363756

Therefore, pricing, return policy and return insurance strategy have attracted considerable research attention. In this paper, we construct four models to study pricing, return policy and return insurance strategy. We show that when a product's net residual value is greater than or equal to zero, online retailers should offer a money-back guarantee (MBG) return policy; however, they do not have to offer free return insurance because the latter does not increase their market share and profit, nor does it increase consumer surplus. The optimal strategy of insurance providers is unaffected by whether the policyholder is an online retailer or a consumer and should be neutral, which helps insurance providers gain the trust of policyholders. Consumers should buy products only when online retailers offer an MBG return policy; however, consumers should not do so if the online retailer provides free return insurance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",e-commerce; Product pricing; Return insurance; Return strategy,consumption behavior; electronic commerce; insurance system; policy analysis; price dynamics; retailing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85094593277

Due to the lack of physical observation of products in online markets, a return policy is used. So, demand behavior is analyzed in terms of the pricing and return policy.

We model an online supply chain which contains customers and one e-commerce retailer. By using simulation, we compare the dynamic performance in a supply chain for two scenarios, namely adopting an online review system and without adopting the system. The supply chain dynamic performance is measured by bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification. The results demonstrate that the online review system increases both the bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification, and this impact can be moderated by product quality, unit mismatch cost, lead time, and customer volatility. We further explore how our model could be extended to include market competition, dual sourcing, online review manipulation, and product returns. As the increase in the bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification can be associated with supply chain inefficiency, managers who are aware of such consequences induced by online review adoption can make better decisions in supply chain management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Bullwhip effect; Inventory variance amplification; Online review; Production control; Simulation; Supply chain dynamics,Competition; Supply chain management; Bullwhip effects; Dynamic behaviours; Dynamic performance; Market competition; Online supplies; Supply chain dynamics; Supply chain inefficiencies; Variance amplifications; Sales,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095814165

When customers are dissatisfied with a product, they will make an extra trip to return that product. Pre-sales service improves customers’ satisfaction with the product and reduces customer returns, but providing that service may be costly for the seller, and not all service leads to immediate sales. In particular, when a channel provides a high level of service, some customers may first visit this channel's store to take advantage of the service, only to buy the product from a cheaper channel (freeriding). This paper examines the impact of customers’ freeriding behavior on a manufacturer's channel strategy. We find that the cost bearer of freeriding (the firm on which the customers freeride) can be better off, and the beneficiary of freeriding (the firm from which the freeriding customers purchase the product) can be worse off, when customers can freeride. We also find that when customers can freeride, the manufacturer is less likely to use the dual-channel structure, and total demand may be smaller, even though customers have the flexibility of choosing where to buy after experiencing pre-sales service. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Freeriding; Game theory; Pre-sales service; Product returns; Supply chain management,Customer satisfaction; Manufacture; Channel strategies; Dual-channel structures; Free-riders; Free-riding; Level of Service; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086114544

In this paper, we develop a model to investigate a monopolistic retailer's customer returns management strategy. The retailer should determine its returns policy: a money-back guarantee (MBG) or no-refund. If an MBG returns policy is offered, the retailer must also decide whether or not to sell the returned products as open-box products. We derive the optimal pricing strategy for each of the returns strategies and identify the retailer's optimal customer returns management strategy. We show when the retailer should implement each of the returns policies, and when it should sell the returned products as open-box products. We also show that even when the retailer cannot handle customer returns efficiently, it could choose to offer an MBG returns policy and sell returned products as open-box products, if the cost of inspecting returned items is low. Finally, we show that the retailer can simplify the choice of returns management strategy based on identifiable quantities and threshold values.

A digital product fitting technology was tested with the retailer’s products and resulted in estimations on how such technology could affect product returns. Findings: The cost of a return is approximately 17% of the prime cost. The major cost elements are product handling costs and transportation costs, which together amount to 72% of the total costs. If well calibrated, the fitting technology can cut fit-related return costs by up to 80%. The findings show how customers reacted to the fitting technology: it was unable to verify fit every time, but it serves as a useful and effective support tool for customers when placing orders. Research limitations/implications: Virtual fit verification using digital product fitting is key to retailers to reduce fit-related returns. Digital product fitting using three-dimensional scanning is more appropriate for some products, but it is unsuitable for products that are difficult to measure and scan. Originality/value: The paper contributes an empirical estimate of retail supply chain costs associated with fit uncertainty, as well as theoretical understanding of the role of pre-sales fit verification in avoiding product returns. © 2021, Emmelie Gustafsson, Patrik Jonsson and Jan Holmström.",3D scanning; Fit uncertainty; Product recommendation system; Product return costs; Product returns; Retail supply chains; Return reasons,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111626893

This requires firms to adopt an integrative approach, addressing each omni-channel design decision from a dual demand-side (marketing) and supply-side (operations) perspective. However, both in practice and in academic research, such an integrative approach is still in an immature stage. In this article, a framework is developed with the following key decision areas: (i) assortment & inventory, (ii) distribution & delivery and (iii) returns. These affect both the customer journey and the product flow. As a consequence of the resulting interdependencies between the firm's functions, addressing the issues that arise in the three decision areas requires an integrated marketing and operations perspective. For each of the areas, the key decisions that affect or involve both the customer journey and product flow are identified first. Next, for each decision, the marketing and operational goals and the tensions that arise when these goals are not perfectly aligned are described. The opportunities for relieving these tensions are also discussed and possible directions for future research aimed at addressing these tensions and opportunities are presented. © 2019 The Authors",Assortment planning; Customer journey; Delivery; Digital business models; Distribution; Inventory control; Marketing–operations interface; Omni-channel; Product flow; Product returns,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077155814

Academic/practical relevance: Many retailers have recently sought to tighten their return policy by decreasing the return period window. We investigate the impact of such a policy change on sales, returns, and profitability for a multichannel retailer. Methodology: We conduct a multimethodology research in which we (1) develop theoretical predictions using an analytical model, (2) empirically test analytical predictions using data from a jewelry retailer that changed its return policy from 100 days to 60 days, and (3) extend the empirical analysis to estimate the impact of the policy change on profitability. Results: We find that the return period policy change does not have any statistically significant effect on sales and return rates for online stores, whereas it decreases sales by 8%, return rate by 2.7 percentage points, and profit by 7.3% per brick-and-mortar store, corresponding to a 2.7% decrease in annual sales for the retailer. The two likely explanations for the insignificant effect for online stores are (1) the low proportion of online customers affected by the policy change and (2) the return displacement effect—in response to the policy change, some affected customers likely accelerate their product evaluation to return within the restrictive policy period. Our analysis also demonstrates that a return period policy change may increase retail profitability if a majority of retail stores operates under high sales volume and high return rates. Managerial implications: Our study suggests that managers of multichannel retailers that consider a change in their return period policies should carefully assess their operational structures and evaluate consumer return behavior at each channel, particularly over the time window between the proposed policy period and the existing policy period.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper contains an empirical research conducted using a survey-based study, which encompassed a sample size of 228 participants and final consumers that have experience in buying/using products derived from the reverse logistics process. Findings: The results indicate that the influence of reverse logistics onto green supply chain competitiveness is dependent on the product return option and is mainly negative with Serbian consumers, since the perceived quality of each of the three return options is considered to be inferior compared to new products. Practical implication: The study's empirical results show the there is a generally negative perception among consumers regarding the perceived quality of each of the three product return options, thus directly questioning the general justification of using reverse logistics in Serbian business practice.

We review the adaptation to the North American setting of certain original JIT procedures. These include use of a “JIT warehouse” when suppliers and assembly plant are further apart. Logistics operations are shown to benefit from the JIT viewpoint regarding new technologies such as the Internet of Things.

Recently, closed-loop supply chain management has become a topic of strategic importance due to its positive environmental and economic impacts. As a result, many organizations integrated manufacturing and remanufacturing operations to optimize the efficiency of their forward and reverse supply chain processes. The focus of this research is to integrate cyclic production scheduling policies in a two-stage closed-loop supply chain. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program to generate an optimal cyclic production schedule with no demand shortages that minimizes the sum of holding and setup costs under a given cyclic delivery schedule required by the customer. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the number of products, the product return rate, and the feasibility ratio are the most critical parameters affecting the model computational performance. For large-sized problems, a heuristic procedure is proposed to generate near optimal production schedules in reasonable computational times. Finally, the illustration of the proposed integrated model with a real case study demonstrated the cost advantage of implementing cyclic production schedules under closed-loop supply chain policy versus cyclic production schedules under manufacturing only policy. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Cyclic delivery schedules; Cyclic production scheduling; Remanufacturing, closed-loop supply chain",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089351805

Thus, relevant companies must implement robust reverse logistics strategies to reflect the increased importance of the capability. Reverse logistics also plays a radical role in any business’s sustainable development as a process of reusing, remanufacturing, and redistributing products. Within this context, outsourcing to a third-party reverse logistics provider (3PRLP) has been identified as one of the most important management strategies for today’s organizations, especially e-commerce players. The objective of this study is to develop a decision support system to assist businesses in the selection and evaluation of different 3PRLPs by a hybrid fuzzy multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. Relevant criteria concerning the economic, environmental, social, and risk fac-tors are incorporated and taken into the models. For obtaining more scientific and accurate ranking results, linguistic terms are adopted to reduce fuzziness and uncertainties of criteria weights in the natural decision-making process. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is applied to meas-ure the criteria’s relative significance over the evaluation process. The fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (FTOPSIS) is then used to rank the alternatives. The prescribed method was adopted for solving a case study on the 3PRLP selection for an online mer-chant in Vietnam. As a result, the most compatible 3PRLP was determined. The study also indicated that “lead time,” “customer’s voice,” “cost,” “delivery and service,” and “quality” are the most dominant drivers when selecting 3PLRLs. This study aims to provide a more complete and robust evaluation process to e-commerce businesses and any organization that deals with supply chain management in determining the optimized reverse logistics partners. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to empirically investigate the impacts of blockchain technology on consumer behavior. We conduct this research in collaboration with a Chinese e-commerce company that has introduced a blockchain platform for tracing. We use a multimethod design by combining natural experiment- and case study methods. First, we collected data from four industries (i.e. milk powder, seafood, alcohol and nutrition) to conduct the experiment, and the findings reveal that the firms that adopted the blockchain tracing system have an increase in product sales and a decrease in product returns compared to those that did not. Second, we conducted a multiple case study with four cases from the four industries. The findings reveal that the adoption of a blockchain tracing system improves supply chain transparency and process management, which then enhances consumer service and trust. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence that adopting blockchain technology can improve firms’ marketing performance.

By developing several basic theoretical models, we find that the firm should choose YR when unit salvage value of returned new product is relatively low; otherwise, the firm should choose NR. Furthermore, if consumers have a strong satisfaction for new product, YR is not beneficial to consumers. Interestingly, if emissions intensity of remanufactured products isn't small, YR compared with NR couldn't curb carbon emissions.

We derive the competing sellers' optimal decisions on price and returns policy with and without online reviews, and we find that online reviews have greater impact on the high-quality seller than on the low-quality seller. If the salvage value of the product is relatively low, the seller has less opportunity to benefit from online reviews when it offers an MBG, as compared to a no-refund policy. The impact of online reviews on the competition between the two sellers has a “symmetric effect area,” where reviews may either weaken or intensify the price competition between the two sellers when they both offer a no-refund policy, but always intensify the competition if they both offer an MBG. We have identified the conditions under which online reviews lead to a win-win, or benefit one seller, or present a prisoner's dilemma for the two online sellers.

Therefore, production routing models have been developed to optimize production and distribution, simultaneously. In recent years, since, the product life cycle has become shorter than in the past, product return policies with fast response times, emphasis on return management, deformation and restorage of finished goods have become very significant. In this paper, the multi-product production routing problem with startup costs and environmental considerations has been studied. Furthermore, reverse logistics and remanufacturing decisions have been integrated. After modeling the problem as mixed-integer linear programming, due to its NP-hardness and the successful application of the Lagrangian Relaxation algorithm (LR) in solving complex supply chain problems, this algorithm has been chosen as the solution method. After applying the standard LR algorithm and the improved LR algorithm that its subgradient optimization method was modified, as a heuristic algorithm, the feasiblizer algorithm is also proposed for feasibilization of the solution obtained from the LR algorithms. To validate the model and solution method, firstly, test problems are solved by GAMS, and then the proposed algorithm is applied to test problems. The numerical results show the good performance of the LR algorithm in medium-size test problems. Finally, based on the computational experiments, managerial insights on the problem have been provided. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",Carbon emissions; Lagrangian relaxation; Multi-product routing; Reverse logistics; Startup cost,Competition; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Lagrange multipliers; NP-hard; Routing algorithms; Supply chains; Complex supply chain; Computational experiment; Efficiency improvement; Environmental considerations; Lagrangian heuristics; Lagrangian relaxation algorithms; Mixed integer linear programming; Sub-gradient optimization; Life cycle,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096965299

Mathematical and predictive statistical methods in reliability engineering can provide valuable contributions under the right circumstances, however, practical engineering must take precedence in determining the cause of the problems and finding solutions to them.

Customer survey data can be used as the prior information in a Bayesian analysis integrated with product returns, reliability tests, and other reliability data sources to improve reliability estimation. Customer surveys are usually designed for purposes other than reliability estimation. Therefore, extracting reliability information from these surveys may be hard or impossible. Even when possible, the extracted reliability information contains significant uncertainties. This study provides an approach for using a reliability-informed customer survey and analyzing the collected data. This paper describes the critical elements of a reliability-informed survey. A generic and flexible mathematical model is then proposed, which utilizes the critical elements to estimate the life distribution. The model converts the various applicable stress profiles into usage cycles/times and estimates the life distribution. The parameters of the life distribution model are estimated through the maximum-likelihood estimation method and Bayesian analysis. The proposed approach is generic and can be used to estimate the life distribution and the reliability of a product at different stress levels and times. A case study is presented in which the approach is applied to a device using a simulated dataset. © ESREL 2021.

Today, most brick-and-mortar stores have either been integrated into or replaced by the online channel. We model the competition among sales channels and analyze its equilibrium structure. We consider two competing retailers and three sales channel configurations—brick-and-mortar, click-and-mortar and strictly online—and derive the conditions under which a Nash equilibrium exists. We rule out product returns in the brick-and-mortar channel, but online purchases can be returned (possibly subject to a restocking fee). Our model allows for repeated returns of an item and its reintroduction into the forward supply chain. We investigate the effect of restocking fees and customer's perceived channel value on the equilibrium as well as the impact of EU legislation addressing free returns. We also analyze some extensions of the model and conduct a numerical analysis to explore whether restocking fee legislation helps or hinders online business. Our results indicate that the equilibrium structure is determined by the values of the return rate, the refund rate, and the online channel attraction. Also, it results profitable to refurbish and reintroduce returned items into the forward chain multiple times. Lastly, in the context of whether to charge or not a restocking fee and the introduction of a new EU legislation, we can conclude that retailers charging a restocking fee should put more effort in order to increase consumer's perceived value, meaning that customers will accept a restocking fee provided they view the online purchase as having higher quality than a brick-and-mortar purchase. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Multichannel competition; Multinomial logit demand model; Online retailing; Restocking fee; Returns management,Brick; Electronic commerce; Mortar; Supply chains; Equilibrium structures; Explosive growth; Nash equilibria; Online business; Online channels; Perceived value; Product returns; Retail competition; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089897941

We develop game models of competing e-tailing supply chains to study how price competition, channel structure of competitor, and consumer returns policy affect collection responsibility scenario. There are two collection responsibility scenarios: manufacturer collection and electronic retailer (e-tailer) collection. We find that in the common e-tailer setting, the channel collection efficiency and existence of the fixed cost are important for the manufacturer to decide whether to accept the e-tailer&#x0027;s transfer of collection responsibility; if manufacturer collection is optimal for a manufacturer, then it is a win-win scenario for both the manufacturer and the e-tailer, i.e., they are better off using manufacturer collection. If e-tailer collection has higher channel efficiency than manufacturer collection, then e-tailer collection is chosen; otherwise, in the presence of fixed cost, we show that 1) both manufacturers collect returned products if market scale is large, the e-tailer collects them if market scale is small; otherwise, different collection responsibility scenarios are used; 2) price competition accounts for the coexistence of different scenarios and reduces the range of manufacturer collection; 3) the channel structure of competitor can reverse the effect of price competition degree on collection responsibility; and 4) the manufacturer with higher restocking fee has a smaller incentive to collect returns products.

This type of mechanism is quite effective, since the majority of product returns management is performed by the retailer. However, in practical industries, the implementation of ROCLSC is still limited. In this study, we investigate a ROCLSC system that involves an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and a retailer. OEM plays a role as a producer of new products, while the retailer is in charge of remanufacturing, collecting, as well as selling and distributing both newly manufactured and remanu-factured products. We develop a mathematical model to maximize the profit of each party. Although several studies have developed models for cores acquisition, here we apply a different cores switching mechanism. We introduced the fixed rate and flat rate mechanisms used in the business-to-business (B2B) system, where product functions are very important to consumers. In addition, this research focuses on ROCLSC where most of the existing cores acquisition models are Manufacturer-Oriented Closed-Loop Supply Chain (MOCLSC). The result of this study shows that the retailer will get higher profits when the product returns are acquired through the fixed rate mechanism, rather than the flat rate mechanism. Therefore, determining the optimal amount of cores collected through the fixed rate mechanism will increase the retailer’s profit, as well as joint profit of both parties. From the results, we also point out an interesting note that the retailer should increase efforts to sell new products along with the increasing proportion of consumer Willingness to Pay (WTP) for remanufactured products. Hence, both OEM and retailer profits can be increased consecutively © 2021.

Despite their importance in the retailing industry, few studies have examined the interplay of return policies with other cues that customers use to make a purchase decision. Toward this end, this study aims to investigate the interaction effects certain salient high-scope and low-scope cues, such as consumer ratings and brand image, and retailers’ return policies have on consumer purchase decisions. Design/methodology/approach: Building on literature from signaling theory and cue scope literature (high-scope and low-scope cues), the authors develop a research model that hypothesizes the interrelationships between return policies, price discounts, customer product ratings and brand image. Three experimental studies investigate the potential interplay between return policies (lenient vs stringent), price discounts (low vs high), customer product ratings (low vs high) and brand image (high vs low) on quality certainty perceptions and purchase intentions. The mediating effect of quality certainty perceptions on the interplay of various factors (return policy, price promotions, consumer ratings and brand image) and customer purchase intentions is also investigated. Findings: Results indicate that a lenient return policy will have a positive effect when consumers encounter high scope cues that signal undesirable aspects of the product (i.e. low consumer ratings, low brand image). In contrast, when high scope cues signal desirable aspects of the product (i.e. high consumer ratings, high brand image), it attenuates the effects of return policy. The findings suggest that quality certainty acts as a psychological process. Research limitations/implications: Service researchers should seek to examine the role of return policies in a more comprehensive manner. Practical implications: Return policies are important cues for consumers while making purchase decision. Thus, retailers need to realize that these policies may need to be more dynamic or tiered, rather than one-size-fits-all. Originality/value: This study provides a more comprehensive view of how consumers consider multiple cues simultaneously in decision-making. Literature has mainly examined the interactions between different high-scope and low-scope cues, but there has been limited research directed toward the interplay between multiple high-scope cues. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Brand image; Consumer ratings; Price discount; Retail; Return policy; Service strategy; Word-of-mouth,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083797900

Methodology: A theoretical dyadic closed loop supply chain is analyzed where the manufacturer re-manufactures products returned by customers, producing “as good as new products” for the retailer. Twelve coordination scenarios were analyzed. For the definition of these scenarios, a framework based on two criteria was proposed: value of information and perimeter of decision making. Findings: Information on returns leads to lower costs than information on demand. In the presence of complete or partial coordination between the actors in the supply chain, it is preferable to have low product return rates. However, if we are in the complete absence of coordination, high rates of return are more convenient as they function as a buffer against uncertainties. The perimeter of decision making (global or local optimization) does not significantly improve the supply chain performance in relation to its costs. Only the exchange of information improves its performance. Therefore, companies should make efforts to exchange information, first, on their lot sizes, then on their returns and finally, on the customer demand. Originality: The novelty of our work relies on an analysis of the closed loop supply chain performance with the simultaneous presence of information, coordination, and uncertainty. © 2020 by the authors.

By applying the Dynamic Capabilities (DCs) view in the context of closed-loop supply chains (CLSC), this study explores how firms can continuously learn from product returns information. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a qualitative Delphi study-inspired approach. Experts from industry and academia are interviewed in two interview rounds. First round of interviews are based on extant research, while the second round allows the experts to elaborate and correct the results. Findings: This study culminates into a conceptual model for incremental learning from product returns information. The results indicate incremental learning from product returns can potentially lead to a competitive advantage. Additionally, the authors identify the sources of information, capabilities along with their microfoundations and the manifestations of product return information. Three propositions are formulated embedding the findings in DC theory. Research limitations/implications: This study supports extant literature in confirming the value of product returns information and opens concrete avenues for research by providing several propositions. Practical implications: This research elucidates the practices, processes and resources required for firms to utilize product returns information for continuous strategic adaptation. Practitioners can use these results while implementing continuous learning practices in their organizations. Originality/value: This study presents the first systematic framework for incremental learning from product returns information. The authors apply the DC framework to a new functional domain, namely CLSC management and product returns management. Furthermore, the authors offer a concrete example of how organizational learning and DC intersect, thus advancing DC theoretical knowledge. © 2021, Ilkka Ritola, Harold Krikke and Marjolein C.J.

This paper considers the consignment stock (CS) policy for a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). To achieve the economic goal, this study presents a multi-echelon supply chain with a single manufacturer, a single retailer and a third-party service provider. The objective is to optimize this three-level CLSC under a Stackelberg game scenario. The other objective is to identify the environmental impact of remanufacturing EOL products. In this CLSC, the manufacturer acts as the Stackelberg leader and the retailer, the third party are the followers. Under manufacturer's leadership, the retailer and the third party acquire three different decision strategies - I, II, and III. In decision strategy I, the retailer acts as the leader and the third party acts as a follower, whereas in decision strategy II, they obtain a Nash game strategy. In the decision strategy III, they act as one unit and decide their decisions centrally.

Judgments of the ECtHR on 'Hot Returns' and Humanitarian Visas as a Focal Point of Contemporary European Asylum Law and Policy,2020,International Journal of Refugee Law,32,4,,569,596,27,1,10.1093/ijrl/eeab004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108666122&doi=10.1093%2fijrl%2feeab004&partnerID=40&md5=9e688f379e01fcfa07c2ebbee3adc626,"Two controversial rulings of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) deserve global attention, since they declined to scrutinize on human rights grounds the prevalent move towards enhanced border controls and externalization practices that define European asylum law and policy at this juncture. In ND and NT, judges deemed the Spanish policy of 'hot returns', without access to basic procedural guarantees, of those climbing border fences to be compatible with human rights. A few weeks later, the Grand Chamber thwarted enduring hopes for judicial innovation in MN when it reasserted a 'primarily territorial' understanding of State jurisdiction and declared inadmissible the claim of a Syrian family from the war-torn town of Aleppo to a humanitarian visa. While the decision on humanitarian visas means that 'non-arrival' policies cannot usually be challenged, critical inspection of the ND and NT judgment displays a confounding combination of restrictive arguments and dynamic elements beneath the surface of a seemingly clear-cut outcome. This lack of judicial precision, which was bound to cause heated debate about the practical implications of the judgment, reflects the basic tension between the prohibition of refoulement and the absence of a right to asylum in classic accounts of international refugee law. It will be argued that the judicial vindication of the Spanish 'hot returns' policy does not call into question non-refoulement obligations; it aims at identifying graded procedural standards for different categories of refugees and migrants. By contrast, the novel insistence on the abstract availability of legal channels of entry presents itself as a humanitarian fig leaf for the acceptance of strict control practices. At an intermediate level of abstraction, the two rulings mark a watershed moment, indicating the provisional endpoint of an impressive period of interpretative dynamism on the part of the ECtHR, which has played a critical role in the progressive evolution of international refugee and human rights law over the past three decades. Experts in asylum law who have become accustomed to supranational courts advancing the position of individuals will benefit from the insights of constitutional theory and the social sciences to rationalize why the former vigour has given way to a period of hesitation and potential standstill, at least in Europe. This analysis employs the perspective of strategic litigation to discuss contextual factors hindering the continued dynamism of human rights jurisprudence in Europe at this juncture.  © 2021 The Author(s) (2021).

In an effort to encourage consumers to buy products, some e-tailers will offer complimentary return-freight insurance (CRI), and it has become an established and recognized practice. Some e-tailers have stopped offering this resource, however, and offer consumers the opportunity to purchase RI. To examine an e-tailer's RI strategy, we consider a market consisting of a manufacturer and an e-tailer. Three alternative scenarios are investigated: 1) Scenario N where there is no RI; 2) Scenario C where consumers may purchase RI; and 3) Scenario S where the e-tailer offers CRI. We find that the introduction of RI increases the price level, and it does not necessarily benefit the manufacturer and the e-tailer. The RI premium incurred by the e-tailer and the return-freight compensation play a critical role in selecting the RI strategy. When the former is low and the latter is high, the e-tailer is willing to offer CRI. Meanwhile, the manufacturer has the incentive to bear the RI premium for the e-tailer. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",E-commerce; Game theory; Product returns; Return-freight insurance,Electronic commerce; Sales; E-tailers; Price levels; Purchase decision; Manufacture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089550429

We calibrate our proposed model to individual panel data in which we observe each consumer’s sequential shopping trips, including the number of products purchased and/or returned at each trip. Through our simulations, we find that product returns can also lead to desirable outcomes for retailers and that the ability to return purchased products incentivizes consumers to make more shopping trips and thus purchase more.

However, some products that do not meet consumers’ expectations cannot be returned to the retailers either because of retailers’ strict restrictions on returns or because of short trial period. With the development of e-commerce, consumers who cannot return their products to retailers can resell them directly to others through electronic peer-to-peer (P2P) second-hand goods markets. This paper examines the effect of the presence of a P2P market on a retailer's optimal return policy when the consumers are strategic and uncertain about their valuations. As a benchmark, we first examine the retailer's optimal return policy when there is only a retailer-run resale market. Then, we analyze the retailer's optimal return policy in presence of both the retailer-run resale market and the P2P market. Theoretical and numerical results show that, first, the presence of the P2P market is detrimental to the retailer in most cases. The presence of the P2P market is beneficial to the retailer only when the unit purchasing cost is very high, the consumers’ acceptance of products in the P2P market is relatively high and the transaction cost in the P2P market is relatively low; second, the consumer surplus is improved by the presence of P2P market; third, when the retailer-run resale market is the only second-hand products market, returned products are sold out; while in presence of the P2P market, the retailer will hold some inventory when the unit purchasing cost is very low; fourth, the selling price of new products is increased and the selling price of second-hand products in the retailer-run resale market is decreased with the emergence of the P2P market while the refund amount is increased in most cases. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Peer-to-peer market; Return policy; Second-hand goods market; Strategic customers; Valuation uncertainty,article; consumer; controlled study; human; market; purchasing; theoretical study; uncertainty,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089709015

In addition, an evaluation of the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty in the mentioned omni-channel scenarios is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed two-phase research methodology is proposed: an initial qualitative analysis with six focus groups followed by quantitative research through surveys with a sample of 323 individuals. The proposed scales were tested for three purchase scenarios: “buy-online-ship-direct” (BOSD), “buy-online-pickup-in-store” (BOPS) and “buy-in-store-ship-direct” (BSSD). The data were analysed using partial-least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) techniques. Findings: In an omni-channel context, the most important element of the logistics service deriving in satisfaction was timeliness for all the scenarios. The return-of-product dimension of LSQ was relevant for satisfaction in “ship-direct” scenarios, while the availability dimension was only relevant for customer loyalty in the BOPS scenario. Customer satisfaction had a positive impact on loyalty in the three purchasing scenarios. Practical implications: These results might provide guidance to managers in order to improve not only logistics procedures and processes but also their relationships with their customers. Moreover, retailers need to account for return policies in ship-direct channels, prioritize punctuality and adapt delivery terms to ensure product availability.

In our research, PPD serves as a key factor in understanding the linkage between WI and product returns. Our results showed that higher-quality WI is associated with a lower level of PPD. In addition, a lower perceived risk (PR) or attractiveness of alternatives strengthens the association between WI and PPD. We also observed that PR partially mediated the moderation effect of the attractiveness of alternatives.

CAS theory highlights the importance of agents who create and self-organize to help systems adapt in unpredictable environments. Design/methodology/approach: This research utilizes data collected from return managers in an online survey and applies regression analyses to estimate the influence of the focal variables. Findings: Empirical evidence of the firm flexibility–firm adaptability link is established, and return processor creativity positively relates to this link. The firm flexibility–firm adaptability link fully mediates the relationship between return processor creativity and returns management performance and partially mediates the relationship between return processor creativity and relationship quality. Nonmediated effects were observed for turnover and revenue size. Practical implications: Managers of returns who embrace an adaptability approach become facilitators of returns by supporting processor creativity. Enhancing the autonomy of processors in their day-to-day work increases the knowledge-creation capabilities of the firm, which helps the firm move forward and adapt in an uncertain environment.

It is established that dimensions of a permanent magnet depend on its properties and the distance of the plant`s working zone from the pole. For ferrobarium magnets and the distance of up to 3 mm, the width of the pole may not exceed 1 cm and the thickness – 42 mm; for the distance of 7 mm, the optimal width will be 2 cm and thickness – 70 mm. With that, for continuous regeneration of deposition surfaces, the optimal ratio of the pole pitch to the pole width is 2.44. It is proved that the efficiency of magnetic dust capture increases with increasing cyclone size and force acting on the particle, and decreases with increasing velocity in the cyclone inlet and the diameter of dust particles. In this case, the total inertial-magnetic efficiency does not depend on the cyclone size and averages 92%. The design of the cyclone plant for wet purification of air and gases is proposed, in which the plant poles pitch depends on the distance to the magnet pole, and the dependence of the magnetic force is always close to the exponent F = 1640exp x (–0.268x), when the field induction for magnets on the pole surface is 0.1 T. The developed cyclone plant allows to catch any dust with efficiency more than 60% even at increase in speed of a stream in the inlet pipe by 1,5–2 times, and also to exclude air suctions and penetration of liquid drops in the cleared stream; reduce the loss of the useful product, return it to the technological process and reduce the dust load on the environment. © 2021, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

The second goal is to improve the management of the product returns process. Background This study was conducted at a food importer and manufacturer in Israel fac-ing a very high rate of product returns, much of which is eventually dis-carded. The firm's products are commonly considered to be a low-cost ge-neric alternative and are therefore popular among low-income families. Methodology A decision support module was added to the plant's business information system. The module is based on a supply chain pricing model and uses the sales data to infer future demand's distribution. Ergonomic models were used to improve the design of the returns warehouse and the handling of the re-turns. Contribution The decision support system allows to improve the plant's pricing and quan-tity planning. Consequently, it reduced the size of product returns. The new design of the returns process is expected to improve worker's productivity, reduces losses and results in safer outcomes. This study also demonstrates a successful integration and of a theoretical economical model into an infor-mation system. Findings The results show the promise of incorporating pricing supply chain models into informing systems to achieve a practical business task. We were able to construct actual demand distributions from the data and offer actual pricing recommendations that reduce the number of returns while increasing poten-tial profits. We were able to identify key deficiencies in the returns operations and added a module to the decisions support system that improves the re-turns management and links it with the sales and pricing modules. Finally, we produced a better warehouse design that supports efficient and ergonomic product returns handling. Recommendations for Practitioners This work can be replicated for different suppliers, manufacturers and retail-ers that suffer from product returns. They will benefit from the reduction in returns, as well as the decrease in the losses associated with these returns. Recommendations for Researchers It is worthwhile to research whether decision support systems can be applied to other aspects of the organizations' operations. Impact on Society Product returns is a lose-lose situation for producers, retailers and customers. Moreover, mismanagement of these returns is harmful for the environment and may result in the case of foods, in health hazards. Reducing returns and improving the handling improves sustainability and is beneficial for society. Future Research The decision support system's underlying pricing model assumes a specific business setting. This can be extended using other pricing models and apply-ing them in a similar fashion to the current application. © 2021 Informing Science Institute.

Design/methodology/approach: Field survey study consisting of two separate surveys conducted with consumers of New York City and neighboring areas of New York and New Jersey. Findings: Product returners and keepers exhibited disparate demographic profiles regarding gender and household income, along with ethnicity to some extent. The two groups also exhibited different predispositions with regard to confidence in the purchase decision and expectations about their purchase. Finally, returners and keepers were engaged in divergent thoughts, feelings and activities to cope with PPD. Practical implications: The findings of this study offer marketing practitioners new knowledge and insight into understanding product returners and keepers and will assist them in developing strategies to reduce and manage increasing product returns by consumers more effectively. Originality/value: This study is the first to present empirical evidence that product returners and keepers have distinct profiles of demographic characteristics and predispositions toward purchase. The study also has found divergent PPD coping strategies used by the two types of consumers, which exposes an obsolete understanding of PPD in the marketing literature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer behavior; Consumer post-purchase behavior; Consumer product returns; Consumer satisfaction and dissatisfaction,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103400490

In this context, developing energy policy and investing in energy were defined as two different factors for renewable energy. Additionally, eight different criteria were also selected based on these two different factors. In the first stage of the analysis, these criteria were evaluated by using a correlation coefficient based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The findings show that five criteria have a relationship with policy factors, whereas seven criteria are related to the investment factor. After that, the fuzzy DEMATEL approach based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets were used to weight these criteria. It was identified that policy returns, policy facilities, and policy technology were the most important criteria. Additionally, a performance evaluation of renewable energy investment alternatives was made with a fuzzy TOPSIS approach based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. It was concluded that wind and solar are the most significant renewable energy investment alternatives. Therefore, it is recommended that there should be government supports for wind and solar energy investments. Within this context, corporate tax discounts for these companies, customs duty decrease for the items used in the investments, and providing qualified personnel in this area can attract the attention of these investors. © 2019 by the authors.",Correlation coefficients; DEMATEL; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Investment; Policy; Renewable energy; TOPSIS,Energy policy; Fuzzy sets; Public policy; Solar energy; Taxation; Correlation coefficient; DEMATEL; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Renewable energies; TOPSIS; Investments,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076157546

For example, some retailers have begun offering consumers the option to purchase online and return items to physical stores if necessary (i.e., buy-online, return-to-physical store (BORP) option). Such cross-channel return policies can be competitive tools while online retail sales continue to grow and return rates from these sales remain high. We investigate the retailers’ strategic decisions on the adoption of the BORP policy from a competitive perspective. In a duopoly setting, we incorporate model elements, including retailers’ price and online return fee decisions and customers’ heterogeneity and forward-looking purchase behavior. We adopt a multistage, non-cooperative game framework and find that the adoption of the BORP policy by one or both retailers can be sustained in equilibrium if the retailers are sufficiently differentiated and when they can recover significantly larger salvage values from items returned in-store than those returned online. Neither retailer offers the BORP option under intense competition and/or when the retailers’ physical channels lose the aforementioned advantages. Furthermore, in the equilibrium with asymmetric adoption of the BORP policy, both retailers are better off compared with that without adoption. However, the retailer who offers the BORP policy is not guaranteed of a larger profit gain than its rival. We provide a systematic explanation for the mechanisms underlying these results and generate further managerial insights by exploring scenarios with free online return service and retailer heterogeneity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Buy-online; Competition; Cross-channel product returns; Omnichannel retailing; Return-to-physical store,Competition; Game theory; Buy-online; Competitive tools; Noncooperative game; Omnichannel retailing; Physical channels; Physical stores; Product returns; Strategic decisions; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077663151

The firm sells new products in the first period and refurbishes the returned products and sells them, along with the new products, in the second period. We find that when more consumers find product fit or when more consumers understand product characteristics, the quantity of returned products will be reduced, the selling prices of the products will be lowered, and the firm's profit will be increased.

Recognizing this, we analyze returns as part of a product search process: on returning a product, consumers may immediately purchase an alternative one, which they may later replace with another product, and so on, until they either ultimately keep their last purchase (Keep outcome) or not (No-keep outcome). We call such a sequence of transactions a product return episode. In this work, we study consumer Keep and return abuse behavior using episodic metrics. Using data from a consumer electronics retailer, we show that analysis of product returns with episodic metrics provides insights that differ from, and go beyond, analyses with commonly used transactional metrics. We find that although higher average price and larger store assortment at a subcategory level both tend to increase the return probability, they also increase the probability of keeping a product at the end of an episode, which points to profit-improving opportunities for retailers by allowing returns and tracking episodes. We also find that episodic metrics are useful for identifying return abuse.

The present study captures, analyses and interprets a managerially relevant variable, namely product return intentions, and helps retail store managers, retail analysts and marketing managers understand the decision journey behind consumer product returns. Specifically, the study looks at the relationship between the consumer’s cognitive dissonance after purchase and product return intentions in the context of both lenient and strict return policies. The study also looks at the ill effects of such return intentions in terms of negative word-of-mouth feedback about the retailer. The results suggest that cognitive dissonance after purchase positively influences product return intentions, which in turn positively influences negative word-of-mouth intentions; however, the relationship remains unaffected in strict and lenient return policy situations. Besides providing crucial insights into the complex consumer sentiments associated with seemingly simple product returns, the research questions the previously held notion of retailers and store managers controlling product returns by imposing strict return policies — a finding of paramount importance to business. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Cognitive dissonance after purchase; Negative word-of-mouth intentions; Product return intentions; Return policy leniency,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099687421

Firstly, CSFs and performance outcomes are extracted by conducting exploratory factor analysis using SPSS software. Then, the relationships between CLSC CSFs and performance outcomes are empirically tested by Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach, using the data collected from 138 professionals working in remanufacturing, refurbishing and recycling operations in North American manufacturing organisations. Empirical analysis demonstrates that CSFs, ‘environmental concerns’, ‘sustainable production’ and ‘product design and collection’ have a significant positive effect on environmental performance. Results also validate the significant positive effect of CSFs, ‘demand and inventory management’ and ‘raw material prices’ on economic performance.

To gain a deeper understanding of its drivers, we surveyed 1081 retail customers about their most recent consumer electronic product purchase to examine the impact of channel-related aspects as well as retailer-related aspects–a dual approach that has not been applied previously. A channel’s anticipated after-sales service and price level are the strongest predictors for webrooming. Moreover, retailer aspects determine whether customers simultaneously switch retailer when webrooming. A retailer’s assurance of delivery, including payment modalities, return policies, and product obtainment, as well as competitive product prices motivate consumers to switch retailer when webrooming. These results suggest that customers have a fundamental need for certainty within and after the buying process, which can be satisfied by both channel and retailer. Additionally, this is the first study to empirically test for interactions between channel and retailer aspects, as they are likely to occur in real shopping situations. We identified two interactions: First, a retailer’s assurance of delivery can compensate for an anticipated lack of a channel’s after-sales service, dampening the impact of the latter on competitive webrooming. Second, retailer’s price attractiveness acts in a similar vein. Hence, to steer customers into channels and/or keep them with the company, retailers should emphasize their price attractiveness as well as assurance of delivery. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cross-channel behaviour; free-riding; Multichannel; research shopping; webrooming,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075189736

The LASSO model also turns in consistent performance based on several robustness tests and is easy to implement in practice.

However, motivational factors or drivers have to be considered to efficiently perform reverse logistics, as well as the different perspectives from stakeholders. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the interrelationship among reverse logistics drivers under the perspectives of the key stakeholders. A grey-based DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) was applied to obtain a multiple company-customer-society-government combination perspective. Experts were consulted to extract the pair-wise comparison of drivers. The most prominent drivers are from inside the organization, namely: 'Eco-design', 'Long-term sustainability', 'Economic viability', and 'Reduction on material consumption and disposal cost.' The main contribution to the field is the uncovering of net effect and the prominence level of each RL driver from each stakeholder perspective separately, and from the overall perspective (aggregated form). The uniqueness and innovation of this research relies on the fact that, as far as the authors know, no study has yet addressed RL drivers under a multidimensional view of the stakeholders, that is: Company, customer, society, and Government. © 2020 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

Modular product design facilitates quick assembling, disassembling, and recoverability. Components of modules use sustainable inputs, manufacturing, and recovery processes. The model plans collection of end-of-life and end-of-use product returns through the retail outlets. Recovery of components from these returns are obtained through a pool of recovery service providers and new components are procured from a pool of partner suppliers. The supply chain creates capacity flexibility through network based partner organizations and pooling capacity of their own plants. The research incorporates supply, production, and recovery flexibility to make the business resilient. The model integrates this resiliency planning with the environment friendly production, recovery, and procurement to make the business sustainable.

Perhaps one of the most pressing structural problems regarding the EU’s return policy is the enforcement deficit in returning irregularly staying migrants. Even though Member States must issue a return decision according to the Return Directive, only 40% of such decisions are enforced. Despite all of the political and legal efforts made, the EU is not making any significant progress in enforcing the rules laid down in the Return Directive. This contribution explores a different legal approach that is already used rather extensively in national legislation of EU Member States, which targets irregular residence through a differentiated system of granting residence permits, that is, regularizations. Hence, this paper argues for an EU Regularization Directive, which could contribute to a reduction in the number of irregularly staying migrants. Through such a Directive, which would complement the existing EU return policy, a more effective ‘combatting’ of irregular immigration at the EU level could be achieved. © The Author(s) 2019.",Comparative legal analysis; deportation; EU Migration Law; EU Return Directive; fundamental rights; irregularly staying migrants; regularization; removal; residence right; return deficit,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077193721

Despite the acknowledgement of the available advantages that can be reaped, there is an overall lack of academic research concerning performance metrics, in particular KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), that can help in managing reverse supply chains. Moreover, industry-specific KPIs have not been explored thoroughly. The apparel industry is currently plagued by high return rates, which suggests that it is even more important for clothing retailers to look over their reverse supply chains. The conceptual framework presented in this report seeks to diminish the gap in literature and provide clothing retailers with KPIs with a focus on environmental sustainability that can help in the decision-making process.

Product returns are delayed and possibly limited in periods of fast growth and excessive in the aftermath. Varying growth/demand and volatile take back by consumers and industrial end-users introduce uncertainty, regarding quantity and quality of returns. As remanufacturing expands, escalating competition for acquisition of high quality returns exacerbates uncertainty. Production planning and control for efficient remanufacturing depends on reliable prediction of quantity and quality of returns. A method is developed for prognosis of product return quantity and quality grades, as reflected by vintage flows. It is anchored on a law relating stock and end-of-life level, under random losses and arbitrary end-of-life distribution. Efficacy is tested via a model that describes stock and flows in reuse/remanufacturing, allowing for varying demand, random stock losses, random product returns with time-varying distributions and time-varying utilisation of product returns. Realisations are obtained by Marko-chain Monte-Carlo simulation. Inherently integral in nature, using scaled data and founded on rigorous balances, the method enables prognosis of returns and age-vintage flows, under realistic conditions, including unknown nonlinearities and non-stationarities. It features improved performance (mean absolute error less than one half) compared to leading methods in-use that employ black-box models with error-driven parameter adaptation (e.g. regression). Efficacy is particularly high at crucial peaks and lows (shortage or surplus periods) enabling resourceful planning of acquisition and inventory control of product returns towards sustainability. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Circular economy; Closed loop supply chain; Forecasting of product returns; Product take-back; Remanufacturing; Reuse,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074001419

Such reactive production quantity, however, is limited by the required preprocessing of raw materials that must be decided before the demand information is updated. We analyze the problem for two cases: perfect and imperfect demand information updates. For the case of imperfect demand updates, whether to engage in preprocessing that provides an opportunity for future reactive production depends on the relative magnitude of the resolved demand uncertainty compared with the unresolved one. In the case of perfect demand updates, however, it is independent of the demand characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide guidance on when and how much to invest in preprocessing in a situation with a general demand forecast updating. We also present a coordinating Pareto-improving reservation contract and show how the manufacturer can extract more profit by setting a lower reservation fee. Counterintuitively, we find that the manufacturer in the case of perfect demand updates benefits more from a contract without a return policy than that with a return policy.

Online retailers typically capture feedback through ratings, comments, and surveys. While surveys broadly capture various aspects of customers’ experience, focusing on returned products can deliver greater insight on how a product did not meet the customer’s expectations. When a product return is initiated, the customer fills out a form describing the reason(s) for return. Return reason categories are often provided by the retailer in a broad manner, while the customers’ description for the return reason provides more information on why this product did not meet their expectations. Understanding product returns provides the retailer with information useful for improving customer experience and cutting down on return costs. This research analyzes return data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Analyzing product returns using LDA provides a more detailed tool to track reasons for product returns which helps observe new emerging patterns that encompass the majority of the returns. This study concluded that studying product returns using LDA is an insightful tool to understand how a product did not meet customers’ expectations.

This study aims to identify and analyzes the interrelationship between barriers affecting RL implementation in Pakistani manufacturing industry using an integrated methodology of Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and MICMAC approach. Results of ISM and MICMAC identified organizational, financial, and technological barriers as dependent barriers. However, lack of government policy incentives, lack of responsiveness about RL, lack of enforceable laws on product return, changing in regulations due to political changes, lack of environmental law awareness and lack of corporate social responsibility emerged out as top-ranked barriers driving other barriers that need to be addressed. An inter-relationship based structural model will be helpful for supply chain and RL professional in understanding major obstacles to RL implementation and develop a strategy to promote RL in the manufacturing industry. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.",environmental degradation; interpretive structural modeling; MICMAC approach; Pakistan; Reverse logistics,Developing countries; Environmental protection; Laws and legislation; Manufacture; Social aspects; Supply chains; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Developed countries; Environmental integrity; Integrated methodology; Interpretive structural modeling; Manufacturing industries; Structural modeling; Technological barriers; Environmental regulations,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086077405

This paper studies the pricing strategies of an integrated dual-channel retailer (DCR) when it provides return policies to customers, including original channel return, fixed cross-channel return, and relaxed cross-channel return. The relationship between the DCR's system performance and channel pricing is impacted by customer channel preferences, and the return rates of different channels are discussed. The results show that the greater the difference in customer preferences between channels is, the greater the profitability of the DCR will be. A fixed cross-channel return model should be selected when the return rate in the online channel is higher or the cross-channel return rate is lower; otherwise, the original channel return model should be selected. When the return rate of a certain channel is high, the retailer should increase the price in that channel and reduce the pricing of its competing channel to compensate for the loss caused by the returns and transfer sales between channels. A selective return policy can not only improve the flexibility of business operations and enhance competitive advantage but also provide convenient customer returns and enhance consumers' sense of security.  © 2020 Xiaojian Hu et al.",,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089770257

However, to maximise the benefits of consumer reviews, online sellers must avoid the negative consequences associated with customer feedback, such as reputation loss, or product returns after purchase. In developing a better understanding of the relationships between online reviews and their potential for negative impacts, this research aims to explore product returns. Through a quantitative model, this research demonstrates why online reviews can result in product return behaviours. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses were tested via two studies. In Study 1, the authors examine the direct effects of review valence and review volume on product returns by analysing secondary data on 4,995 stores on China's Taobao.com. Study 2 further extends and validates the findings of Study 1 with a survey sample of 795 participants across several online shopping platforms. This analysis examines the mechanics and conditions that influence the relationships between online reviews and product returns through partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results show that both review valence (i.e. average star ratings) and the number of reviews can increase the probability of product returns due to the high expectations that result from positive online reviews. Further, the effect of review valence on product returns is stronger for first-time purchasers at a store. In terms of mitigation, the analysis shows that bilateral communications between sellers and buyers can temper the unrealistic expectations set by positive reviews, leading to fewer product returns. Originality/value: This research adds to the literature on online reviews by exploring the negative consequences of online reviews and the role they play in online purchasing decisions. The findings also provide direct evidence as to why online reviews can result in more product returns, adding clarity to extant research which contains conflicting conclusions as to how online reviews affect product return behaviours. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bilateral communications; Consumer expectations; Consumer experience; Online reviews; Product returns,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099753045

Hence, consumers' reliance toward online shopping is getting stronger. Yet, contrasting to the shopping experience in physical store, the chance of impulse buying and product return increases when consumers shops online. Subsequently, problems like post-purchase dissonance (e.g. emotion dissonance, product dissonance) arise as well. Therefore, in order to Figure out what causes impulse buying behavior and the relationship with cognitive dissonance, we adopt the concept from Powers and Jacks [1]. Also, despite of two shopping values as antecedents for impulse buying, we supplement time pressure from Tigli and Kaytaz Yigit [2] as well. Consequently, we attach return tendency, which are to explore the effect of post-purchase dissonance. In this study, we conduct a survey and receive 155 valid response in total, and the result shows that time pressure and emotion dissonance are the main factors influence impulse buying. To sum up. our findings may be useful for retailers attempting to operate websites in e-commerce.  © 2020 IEEE.",impulse buying; post-purchase dissonance; return tendency; time pressure,Data integration; Data Science; Electronic commerce; Sales; Cognitive dissonance; Impulse buying; Online shopping; Physical stores; Product returns; Time pressures; Information use,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092135851

We use a game-theoretic approach to model a CLSC composed of one supplier and one manufacturer. The supplier sets the wholesale price of an intermediate product while the manufacturer sets the selling price of a final product. Further, the manufacturer invests in innovation-led lean practices to entail both a strategic effect and a process innovation effect. The strategic effect consists of responsiveness involving the CLSC's capacity to properly respond to consumers' needs and leading to increase in sales. Further, the strategic effect enhances sustainability as consumers align their behavior to the CLSC's attitude of reducing the waste through lean, thus using their products for longer time period and entirely exhausting their residual value. Innovation-led lean practices also generate a process innovation effect, which consists of the marginal production cost abatement. Our findings indicate that lean practices leading to both strategic and process innovation are profitable for the manufacturer and sponsor sustainability. When only one of those can be presented, CLSCs should prefer the adoption of a strategic lean program. From its side, the supplier is much less sensitive to environmental benefits, thus it focuses on sales and operational matters. Furthermore, in a centralized CLSC, the preferences for strategic vs. process innovation lean follow the same path of the decentralized CLSC. Nevertheless, we pinpoint that the manufacturer in the decentralized CLSC has a larger incentive to adopt a strategic lean program than in the centralized CLSC. Also, the supplier always obtains larger economic benefits in the decentralized CLSC under any type of innovation-led lean program. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Closed-loop supply chain; Innovation-led lean; Process innovation; Sustainability; Used-product returns; Vertical integration,Consumer behavior; Costs; Game theory; Manufacture; Sales; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Environmental benefits; Intermediate product; Operational matters; Process Innovation; Used product; Vertical integration; Sustainable development,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047731305

Conventional wisdom posits that compared to a centralized channel, a decentralized channel induces worse services (e.g., a shorter return window) because of double marginalization. We build a model consisting of one manufacturer, one retailer, and consumers who are heterogeneous in their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for product quality. Counterintuitively, we find that the return window can be longer in a decentralized channel than in a centralized channel. Furthermore, the return window can decrease along with product quality, which means that high-quality products can be offered shorter return windows than low-quality products. When endogenizing product quality, we reveal, contrary to previous findings, that the product quality in a decentralized channel may be higher, even when consumer heterogeneity in product quality follows a uniform distribution. This higher product quality induces a decentralized channel to generate a consumer surplus higher than that of a centralized channel. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society",distribution channel; marketing/operations interface; quality; return policy; return window,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088235644

Since accurate return forecasts are inputs into strategic and tactic decision support tools for operations managers, advancements in better forecast accuracy can yield significant savings from the returns management practice. We propose a forecasting approach that incorporates transaction-level data, such as purchase and return timestamps, and predicts future return quantities using a two-step “predict-aggregate” process. To enhance the generalizability of our framework, we test it on two distinct datasets provided by a bricks-and-mortar electronics retailer and an online jewelry retailer. We find that our approach demonstrates significant forecasting error reduction, in the range of 10–20%, over benchmark models constructed from common industry practices and the existing literature. As our approach leverages the same data inputs as existing models, it can be easily adapted by practitioners. We also consider a number of extensions to generalize our approach into contexts such as restricted return time windows, new product returns, and inflated same-day returns.

In this paper, a reverse logistics EOQ model is studied. The inventory problem of when to order and how much quantity to order when there is reverse flow of items into the system is addressed in the form of profit maximisation. To find the optimal solution of the model (a nonlinear maximisation problem), the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for the objective function are presented and the square-root formulae for the firm's order size and price are derived. A simple algorithm is proposed for a search of the optimal solution. To illustrate the applicability of the model, some numerical examples are given.

Our study takes return policy into a green dual-channel supply chain, wherein a manufacturer creates and sells green products simultaneously. We investigate the pricing and greening strategies for the supply chain players in the cases of providing and not providing cross-channel return service by employing the Stackelberg model under the hypothesis of a consistent pricing strategy. By comparing the equilibrium results of two cases, we find that the retailer will cooperate with the manufacturer to employ the cross-channel return policy when the spillover effect is greater than a threshold. Additionally, the green level of products is higher than before. The threshold decreases with consumers' sensitivity to green products, which implies that the manufacturer is motivated to conduct marketing programs to enhance consumers' willingness to buy green products. Moreover, we propose a contract to coordinate the supply chain. Finally, we discuss the scenarios if the supply chain implements a differential pricing strategy. Interestingly, the green level and the profits of the whole supply chain are greater than that under a consistent pricing strategy. However, the profits of the retailer are lower than profits in the other scenario, which is not beneficial to creating a stable green supply chain. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper introduces for the first time a CLSC consisting of one manufacturer and two retailers in which sold items can be returned from customers in the two categories of non-defective and defective items. The first retailer exercises a Money Back Guarantee (MBG) policy for defective items with a full refund. He also offers an MBG with a partial refund for non-defective items. The manufacturer collects the defective items returned to remanufacture and sell them to a second retailer. The first retailer sells non-defective items returned as open box items at a discount in a second market while the second retailer sells remanufactured items in a third market. Two scenarios are also considered: one in which the manufacturer pays to the first retailer the wholesale price for defective items, and the other in which the manufacturer pays the first retailer's price in order to motivate him to offer exercise the MBG policy for defective items. A numerical Example is finally introduced and the relevant parametric analysis is carried out while managerial insights are extracted from the solution. Results show that the first scenario is more beneficial to all the parties in the supply chain because it not only increases both the manufacturer's and the retailers' profits but also reduces the retailers' prices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Closed loop supply chain; Game theory; Money back guarantee; Pricing; Remanufacturing,Commerce; Costs; Defects; Game theory; Manufacture; Numerical methods; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Defective items; Game-theoretic; Money back guarantee; Parametric -analysis; Remanufacturing; Whole sale prices; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072285407

In an effort to shift the discussion on state-diaspora relations beyond liberal democratic contexts and single-case studies, this article comparatively examines how authoritarian emigration states in the Middle East–Libya, Syria, Egypt, Turkey, and Jordan–behave towards their own citizens living beyond state borders. It identifies how each state develops multi-tier diaspora engagement policies aimed at three separate stages of citizens’ mobility: first, policies of exit regulate aspects related to emigration from the country of origin; second, overseas policies target citizens beyond the territorial boundaries of the nation state; finally, return policies set processes of readmission into the country of origin. In doing so, the article identifies similarities across disparate Middle East states’ engagement with emigration and diaspora policymaking. At the same time, the article paints a more complex picture of non-democracies’ strategies towards cross-border mobility that problematizes existing conceptualizations of authoritarian practices and state-diaspora relations. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053230088

The leftover product has a lower perceived quality than the new product. Therefore, retailers try to influence consumers' preferences through price differentiation that leads to an internal competition based on product age and prices. The price differentiation strategy affects the market demands, sales volume and consequently, the profitability of the whole fresh-product Supply Chain (SC) and its members. This paper addresses the pricing and inventory control problem for fresh products to examine the influence of this competition on the SC members' decisions and profits. Accordingly, a new coordination model based on a return policy with the revenue and cost-sharing contract is developed to improve the profits of independent SC members. The fresh-product SC consists of one supplier and one retailer, where consumers are sensitive to the freshness and retail price of the product. Firstly, the retailer's optimal decisions, including the order quantity and old product price, are made influenced by a decentralized decision-making structure. Then, a centralized approach to optimization of the SC decisions from the whole SC viewpoint is utilized. Finally, a new coordination contract is designed to motivate the members to participate in the coordination model. Numerical examples are presented to compare the performance of different decision-making approaches. The findings indicated that the proposed contract could effectively coordinate the fresh-product SC. Furthermore, the coordinated decisionmaking model is more profitable and beneficial for the whole SC compared to the decentralized one. The results also showed that when consumers were more sensitive to freshness, the simultaneous sale of multiple-aged products at different prices would be more profitable.  © Iran University of Science and Technology 2020.",Cannibalization effect; Channel coordination; Fresh-product supply chain; Pricing and inventory decisions,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096068326

In this study, we explore the BORS adoption strategy and its influence from a competitive perspective. Specifically, we consider two supply chains selling a product in the same market. Each supply chain consists of one supplier and one retailer who operate online and store channels. We find that consumers can return unwanted products to the retailer's online channel if BORS is unavailable or to the retailer's either store if BORS is available. In our study, monopolistic (i.e., integration scenario) and competitive environments are considered and numerical analysis is presented. Results reveal that in a monopolistic environment BORS may hurt retailers in certain situations and cause them not to adopt this strategy. However, competitive environments can make both types of retailers prefer to offer BORS in nearly all conditions. In this case, BORS can benefit both supply chains and their members. Moreover, increasing salvage values of the returned product and the proportion of the returned products that need be handled by suppliers can further enhance BORS profitability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Buy-online-and-return-in-store; Cross-channel product returns; Omnichannel; Retail operation; Supply chain competition,Supply chains; Competitive environment; Online channels; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084341283

In addition, the closer the distance between the minimum price and the price during the high phase of demand, the higher is the degree of price inertia. This model first assumes that the manufacturer sells products to consumers directly and then introduces competing retailers who have the right to return unsold goods at the minimum resale price specified by the manufacturer. By solving for the minimum resale price and production output, the model’s results indicate that vertical market linkages influence the market power–price inertia relation and that asymmetric price transmission could be symbolic of competitive markets. Further, study reveals that the retail price in a highly concentrated retail market might be lower than that in a retail market with fierce competition. In addition, high product durability, low demand uncertainty, low return credit, and long contract duration between upstream and downstream members lead to price inertia rising during economic recessions compared with booms. The relationship between price adjustments and market competition, therefore, suggests that the reasons underlying price inertia should be considered when formulating antitrust and monetary policy. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",Demand uncertainty; Price inertia; Price transmission; Return policy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059834212

The following research questions have been asked in order to realize the purpose of the research: What are the factors affecting the performance of the pension fund? What is the relationship between pension fund performance and contributions, return on investment, and net asset value? Methodology: For the specification of the econometric model of this study, we rely on secondary data published in official World Bank reports and reports of pension funds in Kosovo, Albania and North Macedonia. To measure the empirical results, these statistical tests are used: standard multiple regression, fixed effects model, random effect model, and Hausman Taylor Regression. Findings: Based on the empirical results, we can conclude that the increase in gross domestic product, return on investment, contributions and net assets have positively influenced the performance of pension funds for the countries included in the study. The other independent variable, the exchange rate, on the basis of econometric estimations, has turned out to be non-significant. Practical implications: The empirical results of this study may recommend that relevant institutions in Kosovo, Albania and North Macedonia undertake reforms towards the creation of efficient pension systems, and these reforms are of crucial importance for pension systems, which have an economic and social character in their function as fund accumulators and benefit distributors for the categories in need. Originality: The study is conducted with secondary data and all the empirical analysis are original based on the authors' calculations through econometric models. Through the results of this study we aim to provide additional empirical evidence on the performance of pension funds in Kosovo, Albania and North Macedonia, recommending that relevant institutions improve the functioning of the pension system, as it is a very important part of a financial system of a country which has an impact on economic growth. © 2020 The Authors.",Contributions; Financial performance; Net assets; Pension fund; Return on investment,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087618651

In this study, an innovative proportional acidification method was developed to release phosphate from municipal sludge and acquire struvite, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and acidulated biological activated carbon (ABAC) as three cleaner products. Acidulated treatment could adequately release phosphate from municipal sludge. Over 95% of total phosphorus was extracted at pH 2.0, and 98.9% of soluble phosphate was recovered by activated brucite ultra-fine powder (ABP) as struvite crystal within 30 min at pH 7.0–7.5. The optimal volumetric ratio of acidulated sludge mixture and unacidified supernatant was 4:6 after fermentation process, while 45.4% of strong acid was saved compared to sludge complete acidification. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that struvite crystallization was a process of magnesium ions dissolved and reconstruction. 381.1 mg of phosphate and 159.3 mg of ammonium could crystallize with adding 1 g ABP. Acetate and propionate occupied 74.2%–82.3% of total SCFAs at neutral fermentation condition, and one kilogram dry sludge could recover 0.079 kg acetate and 0.023 kg propionate. Moreover, the FE-SEM micrographs and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis indicated that ABAC had better physical properties than conventional biological activated carbon (BAC). The recovery process of all three products avoided creating new pollutants, and scheme economic assessment showed roughly balance of chemical cost and products return.

The connection between I4.0 and CE is unveiled by addressing the case-based model affecting the economic and environmental performances imparting two important dimensions: (i) the information sharing with the reverse logistics system is in real-time mode, and (ii) diffusion of green product in the market. The effectiveness of the virtual world in I4.0 environment is explored using simulation of reverse logistics model involving operations such as inventory and production planning policy, family-based dispatching rules of remanufacturing, and additive manufacturing. The remanufacturing model examines the trade-off between set-up delays and the availability of green transportation. For managerial insights, Taguchi experimental design framework has been used for the analysis. Based on the trade-off analysis between environmental and economic performances, the findings of the paper suggest appropriate combinations of information-sharing and family-based dispatching rules. Further, the findings suggest that, given the I4.0 and circular capabilities, it is necessary to focus on the cost of the socially influenced operations involving factors such as collection investment and size of the end-user market that governs the product returns. Therefore, in the present paper, the integration of I4.0 and CE represents a real-time decision model for the sustainable reverse logistics system. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Circular economy; Family-based scheduling; Industry 4.0; Operations excellence; ReSOLVE model; Sustainable reverse supply chain,Environmental management; Industry 4.0; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Investments; Production control; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Virtual reality; Circular economy; Economic and environmental performance; Environmental and economic performance; Family based dispatching; Inventory and production; Operations excellence; Reverse supply chains; Taguchi experimental design; economic activity; manufacturing; modeling; supply chain management; article; diffusion; experimental design; investment; simulation; Economic and social effects,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075058351

We rely on data about millions of rentals of a free floating car sharing operator based on internal combustion engine cars that we recorded in four cities. We characterize the nature of rentals, highlighting the non-stationary, and highly dynamic nature of usage patterns. Building on this data, we develop a discrete-event trace-driven simulator to study the usage of a hypothetical electric car sharing system. We use it to study the charging station placement problem, modeling different return policies, car battery charge and discharge due to trips, and the stochastic behavior of customers for plugging a car to a pole. Our data-driven approach helps car sharing providers to gauge the impact of different design solutions. Our simulations show that it is preferred to place charging stations within popular parking areas where cars are parked for short time (e.g., downtown). By smartly placing charging stations in just 8% of city zones, no trip ends with a discharged battery, i.e., all trips are feasible. Customers shall collaborate by bringing the car to a charging station when the battery level goes below a minimum threshold. This may reroute the customer to a different destination zone than the desired one; however, this happens in less than 10% of all trips. © 2019 IEEE.",Car sharing; charging station; data driven optimization; electric vehicle; free floating,Charging (batteries); Electric discharges; Electric vehicles; Sales; Stochastic systems; Battery charge and discharge; Charging station; Data-driven approach; Data-driven optimization; Design solutions; Destination zones; free floating; Stochastic behavior; Secondary batteries,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073833688

The objective of this study is to highlight pros and cons of two incentive policies, namely (1) incentive on manufacturer’s R&D investment and (2) direct incentive to consumer based on greening level of the product on the optimal pricing and investment decisions in improving used product return and greening level decisions in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). Optimal decisions are derived under manufacturer and retailer-Stackelberg games, and results are compared to explore characteristics of optimal decisions, consumer surplus, and environmental improvement under two marketing strategies of a manufacturer. It is found that the greening level and used product return rate in a CLSC are always higher under retailer-Stackelberg game. If the manufacturer sets a target for greening level, the CLSC members may receive higher profits if consumer receives incentive because of higher consumer surplus. However, environmental improvement may be lower. If the manufacturer sets a product return goal, then CLSC members may compromise with consumer surplus or environmental improvement for receiving higher profits. In the presence of direct incentive to consumers, CLSC members can trade with product at lower greening level for higher profits. Moreover, investment in improving used product return is always less compared to the investment in improving greening level. © 2019, The Author(s).",Closed-loop supply chain; Government incentives; Remanufacturing; Stackelberg game,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077532940

Fashion rental business is competing with fashion retailers, but also reduces fashion retailers’ product returns -fashion goods are “illegally” rented by customers, which was one of the most headache issues for the retailer. In this paper, we investigate the illegal renting behavior. We not only examine the impacts of consumer behavior on fashion retailing, but also the tradeoffs between product rental and purchase in the presence of rental services. We find that when the customer valuation is sufficiently low, customers would not purchase anything; when the customer valuation is increasing, customers will change the behavior from renting the product to illegally rent; when the customer valuation is sufficiently large, customers would purchase the product. Moreover, our analytical results show that customers are not willing to return the products if the cost of product returns is sufficiently high, and also are not willing to rent if the rental fee is too expensive. To decrease the illegal renting behavior, the firm can increase the cost of product returns. Last but not least, we identify that the retailer, the renter and the entire retail system could perform better when the renter and retailer are integrated into one group. This result provides important managerial insights on the giant luxury fashion groups such as PPR and LVMH who should merge the rental firms such as fashion renter (e.g. Rent the Runway) or the fashion retailer Ann Taylor releases a new channel to offer rental service, so that improve the entire fashion retail ecosystem. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Fashion rent; Product returns; Product sharing; Retailing; Sharing economy,Consumer behavior; Crime; Fashion rent; Product returns; Product sharing; Retailing; Sharing economy; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066450891

The P2R contract is offered by the manufacturer to the retailer. In this paper, a practice-based approach is adopted in which we first report the use of P2R contracts in the real world from industrial interviews. Based on the meanings of risk as revealed from the interviews, we proceed to construct analytical models and derive the minimum risk coordinating P2R (PMR∗) contract, which yields the minimum level of risk for the manufacturer and coordinates the supply chain. We analytically show that the manufacturer's expected profit is increasing with the return price and the rebate value under the PMR∗ contract. We reveal that different risk measurements may lead to different PMR∗ contracts. In particular, when the price-dependent demand distribution takes the additive form, we interestingly find that the manufacturer can become riskfree in coordinating the supply chain with the PMR∗ contract; however, it is not the case for the multiplicative case. Furthermore, we observe that the demand distribution's shape affects the setting of the PMR∗ contract.

The recurring explosions of smart cell phone batteries in recent years is why green products are deemed quality-deficient. However, few researchers has paid attention to this issue, and there is no consensus in the previous literature regarding the impact of returning defective products on vertical dual-channel management in closed-loop supply chains. According to past studies, there are two types of product returns: 1) defective item return and 2) waste product return. The model in our study is based on these two types. However, available studies are not based on this model. Second, we examine how closed-loop supply chain members determine the product quality and price in the presence of return on defective items.

It is argued that this change of meaning has been detrimental to the exploration of the link between return, reintegration, and development. Today, critically questioning these powerful paradigms constitutes a daunting challenge for practitioners and researchers alike. To do so, we need to adopt a method that critically examines what current ‘return policies’ really address and prioritise on the ground. This contribution shows that comparing without equating return with removal is possible and necessary through the lens of migration cycles. It concludes by arguing that current ‘return’ policies fail to address the link between return, reintegration, and development.

In response, firms may tailor their products and allow service cancellations. We consider the joint product customization and refund policy decisions of a monopolistic firm selling to a heterogeneous customer population with imperfect signals on their valuations. Our results shed light on how customers’ valuation uncertainty, characterized by the valuation heterogeneity and signal quality, drives the interaction between product line and refund policy designs. In particular, when the valuation heterogeneity is high, the firm may choose to offer a single quality level with a full refund, leading to a variety reduction in the product line. In contrast, when the valuation heterogeneity is low, the firm will always offer a full product line without any refund. At moderate valuation heterogeneity, both qualities and refunds are subject to more customization, and a partial refund can be optimal when the signal quality is high, even though our setup does not involve aggregate demand un-certainty, capacity limitations, competition, or channel conflicts. Interestingly, despite its appeal, generous refund terms do not increase aggregate customer surplus. Furthermore, the firm may not have incentives to reduce customers’ valuation uncertainty even if doing so is costless. We verify the robustness of our results and discuss their practical implications. © 2020 INFORMS.",Cancellations; Consumer uncertainty; Partial refunds; Product line design; Quality; Return policy; Services,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083047023

Sellers are facing challenges from global markets and competitors. Those challenges include product updates faster, product value changes over time, and consumer’s demand becomes more and more personalized, diversified, and predicted difficulty. The seller frequently made use of price promotions and return policies to induce more consumers to buy. These policies have trained consumers to become more and more sophisticated. As such, consumers always strategically choose the chance to buy products at lower prices. In other word, consumers often delay to purchase strategically and even apply the seller to return the full or partial refund for them, which damages the benefit of the seller. While advance selling can improve the accuracy of demand forecasts, increase the seller’s profit, and make consumers avoid the risk of stockout in the sale season by preordering or buying in advance. Therefore, different economic entities have adopted the Web platform to provide advance selling with the return policy of tangible products or intangible services for the consumer, which can enhance the consumer product value but encounter the risk of higher returned amounts. So, how to deal with the returned product has become a core problem that the seller must solve, especially facing more and more complicated strategic consumer. First of all, in the model setting, this paper divides the consumers into high-type consumers and low-type consumers according to the consumer’s product value. All the high-type consumers are strategic. All the low-type consumers arrive in the second period. The demand for both types of consumers is relevant. To attract consumers to purchase in advance, the seller will provide return policy. In the case of not affecting the secondary sales of returned products, the preorder customers will choose to return the preordered product after receiving the product in the regular selling period if they find that the actual product value is less than the refund provided by the seller. Buyers will choose to retain the product if the actual product value is higher than the refund. The seller deals with the return in two ways. One is that the returned product is no longer sold, the other is that the returned product is sold at the same price of the new product in the regular selling period. This is no fault return since the returned product has no quality problem. This paper assumes that the remaining consumers will have the same maximum willingness to pay for the returned product and the new product. Secondly, based on the consumer behavior theory, rational expectation equilibrium theory, and newsvendor model, this paper analyzes the influence of several different return guarantee mechanisms of advance selling with limited manufacture capacity. The total market demand (normalizing the total market size as 1) on the seller’s profit is determined at the same time of taking into account the strategic behavior and return behavior. This paper establishes three advance selling and return models with the capacity constraints, and studies how the design of the seller’s advance selling and return policies are affected by three different strategies: single advance selling strategy, advance selling strategy with return product no resold and return product regularly resold strategy in the presence of strategic consumer. The research discovers when the seller capacity is limited, and the disposal cost of the returned product is low enough, the seller gains the optimal expected profit by combining advance selling with the return policy of the returned product resold regularly as the preorder demand is less than half of the seller capacity. Conversely, the seller is adapted to use a single advance selling strategy without offering any return guarantee when the preorder demand is more than half of the seller capacity. Finally, this paper verifies the validity of conclusions by adopting the numerical simulation analysis and suggests that the seller is more beneficial from the return guarantee mechanisms of the advance selling. It is necessary for the seller to improve the processing level of the returned product as much as possible to reduce the reprocessing cost.

It is becoming difficult for the third reverse service provider to forecast the quantity and quality of returns accurately because of the uncertainties of consuming circumstance, using habit and location of recovery, the reverse logistics of electronic products encounter the uncertainties of collecting quantity, collecting time and collecting quality. For the third reverse logistics service provider, improving the accuracy of returns forecasting is crucial to improve its operational efficiency and service quality. Firstly, this paper introduces the single forecasting models, including GM(1,1), RGM(1,1) and FTS, and analyzes their characteristics and applicable conditions theoretically. The GM(1,1) model has good approximation effect on the latest data, but it is sensitive to the trend of the sequence. The fluctuation of the sequence will greatly affect the forecasting performance. The FTS model can deal with the noise caused by fuzziness in uncertain data and mine more information in the original sequence. It has better adaptability to the fluctuating sequence. However, there will be a certain lag in grasping the trend of the sequence. This paper considers the uncertainty and fuzziness of the quantity of the returns, and proposes a two-period forecasting model FTS_GM(1,1) based on GM(1,1) and FTS to forecast better by utilizing the advantages of each model. In the first period, when the development coefficient of GM(1,1) |a| ≤ 1, the forecasting value in GM(1,1) is adapted as the forecasting value in FTS_GM(1,1) because of the good approximation effect on the latest data of GM(1,1). After period one (in the second period), the FTS model is introduced because the error of GM (1,1) will increase greatly with the exponential growth of grey interval with the gradual departure from the actual sequence. The forecasting value in FTS_GM(1,1) is the weighted value of the ones in the GM(1,1) and FTS with variable weights. Due to the worse performance of GM(1,1) in the long term, the variable weight of GM(1,1) is influenced both by the initial weight and the weight attenuation coefficient. In the numerical experiment, this paper collects the historical data of the quantities of the returns in a reverse logistics firm. At first, four forecasting models(GM(1,1)、RGM(1,1)、FTS、FTS_GM(1,1)) are used to make a forecast for one kind of electronic product in the firm respectively, and the results show that FTS_GM(1,1) performs the best. To examine the applicability of FTS_GM(1,1) for other products, five models (moving average model, GM(1,1), RGM(1,1), FTS, FTS_GM(1,1)) are used to make a forecast for all products in the firm respectively. The results also show that FTS_GM(1,1) performs the best in each indicator (MAD、MSE、MAPE) and there is still a lot of room for the performance improvement of moving average method applied in the firm due to the limitation of its management decision level. Also, it is not difficult to find from the comparison results that no method will always perform the best for all types of returns because the sequence of returns quantity is various in an uncertain system due to the complex and changeable situation in practice. Each forecasting model has its limitation, and a single model cannot be applied to all products. Finally, this paper proposes the returns forecasting system prototype based on FTS_GM(1,1) supplemented with other forecasting models, which can examine the selected models in practice and match the best forecasting model, to improve forecasting performance for different products. The reverse logistics service provider can improve forecasting performance by selecting the appropriate model in return forecasting system and reduce the risk of over or insufficient purchase of maintenance spare parts. By this way, the service provider will reduce the spare part inventory and accelerate responding speed to improve its operational efficiency and service quality. © 2020",Electronic product; Hybrid algorithm; Return forecasting; System prototype,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123172360

Design/methodology/approach: This research focuses on these aspects through the expectation disconfirmation theoretical lens, looking at the relationship between expectations shaped by the product return policy and the repurchase intention. This research collects data using a survey approach and analyzes it using structural equation modeling. Findings: It was found that perceived return policy leniency, perceived fairness of the return experience and perceived quality of the return experience are important and supporting factors that influence a customer’s intention to be a return customer to e-tailers. Perceived leniency was found to not only be the most influential factor for return purchase intention but it also significantly impacted the perceived fairness and the quality of the return process. As a result, perceived leniency of the return policy had a “halo” effect on the other factors. Practical implications: This suggests that the majority of an e-tailer’s effort should be expended determining a return policy and experience that is widely perceived as lenient as this will overall improve customer perception of the return process and increase repurchase intention.

Here, the manufacturer has two adjacent production units – the main production unit and a refurbishment unit. The main production unit of the manufacturer is imperfect, which produces an admixture of perfect and defective items. He inspects all the products immediately after production and sells good quality items to the retailer. The retailer receives a proportion of faulty products from him due to his erroneous inspection process, which he returns after inspection. The manufacturer sends all the defective products received from the retailer and the main production unit to the refurbishment unit for reworking. Moreover, the learning effect of the employees on the production cost is considered. Under these circumstances, the cost functions of each of the supply chain players have been derived.

The issue of returns has become a stumbling block to the profitability of e-commerce companies. To protect consumers' purchase rights, the Chinese government has introduced a 7-day unreasonable return policy. In order to use the return policy to attract consumers to buy, various e-commerce platforms have created a more relaxed and convenient return environment for consumers. On the one hand, the introduction of the return policy has increased customer trust in e-commerce platforms and stimulated purchase demand. On the other hand, the return behavior also increases the cost of the e-commerce platform. With the upgrading of consumption, customers pay more attention to personalized experience. In addition to considering price when purchasing online, the quality of services provided by e-commerce platforms will also directly affect customers' purchasing decisions and return behavior. Therefore, under the personalized return policy of the e-commerce platform, whether consumers will make another purchase is worth studying. In order to achieve this goal, an ensemble learning method (AdaBoost-FSVM) based on fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) is applied to predict the purchase intention of consumers. First, the grid search method is used to optimize the modeling parameters of the FSVM base classifier. Second, the AdaBoost-FSVM ensemble prediction model is constructed by using multiple base classifiers. In order to evaluate the performance of the prediction models used, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), FSVM, random forest (RF), and XGBoost were used to construct prediction models for purchasing behavior. The experimental results demonstrate that the method used in this study has a more accurate prediction effect than the comparison algorithms. The predictive model used in this study can be used in the recommendation system of shopping websites and can also be used to guide e-commerce companies to customize various preferential policies and services, so as to quickly and accurately stimulate the purchase intention of more potential consumers.  © 2020 Peng Wang and Zhengliang Xu.",,Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Electronic commerce; Forecasting; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Predictive analytics; Purchasing; Sales; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Accurate prediction; Behavior recognition; Ensemble learning algorithm; Fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM); Multiple base classifiers; Preferential policies; Purchasing behaviors; Purchasing decisions; Consumer behavior,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098687145

However, little is known about their influence on consumers’ purchases, return behavior, and, ultimately, firm profit. The authors propose that free shipping promotions encourage customers to make riskier purchases, leading to more product returns. They estimate the impact of these promotions on purchase incidence, high-risk and low-risk spend, and return share. The results show that free shipping promotions increase expenditure for high-risk products, expanding their share of the consumer’s market basket and thus increasing the overall return rate. This is validated in a field experiment. A field test and an online lab experiment analyze the mechanism linking free shipping and returns. The results suggest that the free shipping effect occurs through consumers’ perceptions that free shipping serves as a risk premium compensating them for potential returns and through positive affect generated by the promotion. A simulation shows that for the focal firm, free shipping promotions increase net sales volume, but higher product returns and lost shipping revenue render these promotions unprofitable. © American Marketing Association 2020.",e-commerce; free shipping; product returns; promotions,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087312659

They may feel disappointed if the outcome is worse than their prior expectation. This paper explores the effect of consumer disappointment aversion on the online seller's decisions about pricing, ordering and quick response, where the seller can implement either a partial-coverage strategy or a full-coverage strategy. We identify conditions under which the seller should choose a partial-coverage strategy to target only “high-value” consumers. Furthermore, we show that disappointment aversion has a significant impact on the employment of quick response. In particular, when the degree of disappointment aversion is sufficiently high, the seller who implements a no-refund policy should not adopt quick response. Finally, we find that the effect of consumers’ disappointment aversion on the seller's profit depends on the latter's return policy. If the seller provides no refund to consumers, disappointment aversion is always detrimental to the seller. However, a seller who provides a full refund to consumers may benefit from disappointment aversion. Particularly, it is profitable to adopt a full-refund policy when disappointment aversion and salvage value exceed certain thresholds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Consumer returns; Market-coverage strategies; Product value uncertainty; Quick response; Strategic consumer behavior,consumption behavior; electronic commerce; employment; market system; price determination; profitability; uncertainty analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082813259

However, their contribution to sustainability performance is yet to be explored. The purpose of this paper is to explore the product returns in Indian electronics industry and examine the relationship of forecasting product returns with triple bottom line performance of RL. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, based on past literature review, four hypotheses, relating to forecasting of product returns and its association with performance, were developed. A questionnaire was sent to 700 respondents from the Indian electronics industry. Overall, 208 received responses were found suitable for the research. The necessary statistical analysis was carried out to ensure the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. In order to test different hypotheses, partial least square path modelling (PLSPM) technique of structural equation modeling was utilized. Findings: Measurement model had shown sufficient data fit for the modeling. PLSPM results reveal that the accuracy in forecasting product returns is positively associated with operational performance of RL. It also plays an important role in the sustainability efforts of an organization. Research limitations/implications: Managers can utilize results of study for exploring and emphasizing issues of product returns for improving RL performance. One of the limitations is that data are collected only from Indian electronics industry. Another limitation is that only product returns are considered for the operational and TBL performance of RL. In future, study may be carried out considering different factors in other sectors and countries. Originality/value: The intent of forecasting product returns is considered to be operational efficiency. It can make significant contributions to the sustainability efforts of an organization.

The pain of payment reduces over time, in a phenomenon called payment depreciation (PD). Researchers have examined this phenomenon in situations when payment precedes consumption by long periods, ranging from three weeks to several years. The present study examines the occurrence of payment depreciation when costs precede benefits by short periods, such as three days to two weeks. The three experiments establish the presence of PD in short intervals of less than two weeks. The results are robust for both inventoried and non-inventoried consumption. The results further suggest that the sunk cost of a payment devalues discretely and not continuously. The value of the sunk cost in the consumer's mental account drops significantly after two weeks, as compared to one week. The results fail to demonstrate the effect of payment mode on the payment depreciation phenomenon. Implications indicate that retailers can vary their order delivery period to reduce product returns. © 2019",Benefit; Cost; Payment depreciation; Short periods; Sunk cost,cost-benefit analysis; electronic commerce; experimental study; Internet; retailing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073630850

Our research contributes to the growing body of reverse logistics literature, offering insight into how a retailer's logistical returns management strategy can impact inventory effectiveness in cross-channel retail environments. Adopting a contingency framework, we develop research hypotheses which we test through experimentation on a Multi-Echelon retail inventory system within a discrete-event simulation. Model parameters are derived from data collected from a large U.S. retailer of consumer durable and nondurable goods. We find an amplifying effect of a cross-channel returns policy on the positive relationship between a decentralized returns processing structure and inventory effectiveness. Further, through our analysis of nonstationarity in demand and resulting returns, we uncover strong main and interaction effects that seasonal demand variation can have on inventory outcomes, even under only moderate levels of seasonality. Our results highlight the need for firms to align logistical structures for returns processing with the returns policy and the external environment, while also lending credence to calls within the logistics literature for improved modeling of nonstationary demand in inventory management research. © 2019 Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals",cross-channel; discrete event simulation; retail returns management; reverse logistics,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065170517

We show that when pricing is not a decision, the assortment problem does not have a simple structure, but we provide an approximation algorithm to solve it. When prices and assortment can be controlled, the optimization becomes tractable: product prices can either be set so that potential return costs are added to the product price, be reduced to ensure that consumers choose to evaluate them after an exchange, or be set so high so that the items are effectively excluded from the assortment.

In the European Union, for example, the rights of rejected asylum-seekers are well guaranteed and monitored in the pre-return and return phases. Systematic monitoring of forced returns stops when the deportee arrives at the airport of his or her country of origin. The sending countries do not know what happens to rejected asylum-seekers and irregular migrants upon return. International human rights organisations have started to pay attention to this gap in the international protection system. Ignorance by States in this regard deprives them of important insights from the viewpoint of human rights protection and return policies. This article explores what comprises post-return monitoring, what kinds of post-return monitoring projects have been carried out so far and how post-return monitoring could be implemented in the future. The article also discusses the role of post-return monitoring in the refugee determination procedure. It is argued that post-return monitoring could both strengthen the protection of refugees and asylum-seekers and assist States in creating effective, transparent, and morally responsible return policies. © 2019 Author(s).

Sources of data for such initiatives come from both internal processes as well as the customer. Costs of quality (COQ), with emphasis on failure costs, have been used for managing quality and prioritizing actions for decades because of their appeal to top management. These costs are divided into two groups: conformance and nonconformance. Conformance costs can belong to either the prevention or appraisal categories while nonconformance or failure costs can be either internal or external. External failure costs result from the negative experience customers have with products and services. Typical COQ programs include readily identifiable costs such as product returns or scrap. However, many hidden costs can be challenging to correctly identify or may seem to belong to more than one category. In any case, failure to identify a given cost as a quality cost or incorrectly categorizing it may result in misleading decision on actions to improve quality. In this paper, a model will be proposed for correctly categorizing costs of quality. If the cost does not belong to any category, it will be identified as such (not a quality cost). The proposed model will be used as a teaching tool in a senior-level quality improvement course at Ohio University. The model will be tested with cost examples using the following questions: Can students using this model correctly identify whether a given cost is a quality cost? and (2) Do students using the model achieve significantly better results in correctly categorizing COQ than the traditional method for teaching the subject? The same set of costs will be used to answer these questions. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,Digital storage; Sales; Innovation initiatives; Managing quality; Negative experiences; Ohio University; Product returns; Products and services; Quality improvement; Simple modeling; Customer satisfaction,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095793953

Price fairness played an essential role in reducing risk and enhancing trust among low-income customers. Therefore, perceived risk reduction strategies are more suited for low-income consumers. For high-income consumers, trust was crucial. Also, product and service quality was equally vital for both segments. Managers selling organic food to high-income customers should focus on the retailing mix elements to build trust in the retailer. However, for low-income customers, managers should justify the price premium as fair. Also, managers may try to reduce financial risk by mechanisms such as money-back guarantees or liberal return policies for low-income customers. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",fairness; Income; organic foods; perceived risk; price; quality; trust,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087654368

We assume that the market demand at the retailer's end is stochastic, but dependent on price and quality of the product. The final product's quality depends on the manufacturing process and the raw material's quality. We first develop models for centralized and decentralized scenarios. Then we try to coordinate the decentralized system with some contract mechanism. We show that revenue sharing contract is not able to coordinate the system, but a composite contract comprised of sales rebate and penalty (SRP) with return is able to coordinate the system. Finally, we illustrate the developed model with a numerical example and show the efficiency of SRP with return policy. We graphically show the effects of various model-parameters on the optimal decisions. Most of the existing literature's focus on the quality of the finished product, but in this model we incorporate the quality of the raw material as a decision variable along with the finished product quality.

Returns of used products as buyback cores are modelled to depend on past demands and past sales. We derive an optimal inventory policy for the model in which returns are forecast to depend on past demands, and analyze properties of the optimal cost and optimal policy we derived. As the structure of the optimal inventory policy for the model in which returns are forecast from past sales is unlikely to be tractable, we instead consider a feasible inventory policy with a nice structure for this model. We investigate how close this policy is to optimality and find that in the worst case, the difference in system costs between the feasible policy and the optimal inventory policy is bounded by a constant that is dependent only on cost parameters, mean demands and a discount factor, and is independent of the planning horizon and initial inventories. We also perform numerical experiments to study the difference between system costs under the feasible policy and those under the optimal policy. © 2020, The Author(s).",Dynamic programming; Inventory policies; Remanufacturing; Return’s forecasting; System cost,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083459493

The basic thesis of this study is that the direction of the directive’s recast, assuming – inter alia – an extension of the list of circumstances for applying the entry ban and detention, is contrary to the declared fairness of the migration policy towards third-country nationals. At the same time, the effectiveness of the planned changes is already questionable at the stage of draft legislation. These considerations are based on a juxtaposition of the proposed changes with currently binding legislation, the Commission’s soft law and the case law of the CJEU. The final effect of these analyses is the finding that the solutions proposed by the Commission will lead to an inevitable increase in the use of coercive measures against irregular immigrants in a way that stands in fundamental contradiction to the declared fairness and proportionality of EU actions. In this context, the effectiveness of the return policy should not be identified with a percentage of returns, but rather with the recognised necessity of overall and perfect control over irregular migrants. At the same time, the Recast Return Directive will contribute to the deve-lopment of an already existing tendency to treat migration law as an instrument of security and public order, and to use administrative law measures so that they function in a manner equivalent to that of a criminal sanction. © 2020 Author.",Detention; Entry ban; Human rights; Proportionality,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102044211

In the context of the EU’s current measures to strengthen the effectiveness of the return policy, the punitive potential of detention-relation provisions of the Directive became flagrant. The underlying rationale behind the current interpretation of the Directive is a policy of deterrence, retribution, and incapacitation. While immigration detention under EU law may be in practice punitive in nature, the protective features that accompany criminal processes are not always assured within immigration procedures, because of their administrative classification. This gap—the crimmigration phenomenon—allows states to benefit from the broader discretion typical of administrative proceedings and exacerbates migrants’ vulnerability. As the chapter concludes, to tackle the crimmigration phenomenon within the EU pre-removal detention regime, arguments should focus on the prohibition of arbitrary detention and the right to an effective remedy, benefiting every detainee. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108089870

In this study, a supply chain composed of a dominant retailer and a non-green product supplier is investigated. Base demand is always fluctuating in the real market. Thus, considering the base demand disruption risk is one of the factors approaching the problem to reality as discussed in this model. Then, the retailer encounters the challenge of entering a new supplier producing the substitutable product of the first product. New supplier produces the green product. Thus, the competition of green and non-green products in this study is considered with other factors. Another challenge for retailer is the type of optimal alliance, determining the optimal green degree of the second product, and determining the optimal refund amounts. In this study, some factors such as base demand disruption risk, green product, alliance selection, and return policy are considered. A game theory approach is used for solving the problem and getting optimal decisions.

We find only under a specific condition, the feedback Markov equilibrium exists, and the expected return rate would approach to the stable state, regardless of the fairness type the retailer is. The equilibrium prices are decreasing over the return rate, and the equilibrium collecting control strategy is increasing over the return rate. The increasing of stochastic disturbance intensity can be beneficial to the supply chain members. The manufacturer should shift profit to the retailer since the retailer is fairness concern.

The area of product returns continues to be an under-researched area, despite its significance to manufacturers and retailers (Yon Seo et al. 2015). To date, a large amount of the research on product returns seeks to identify personality traits of customers, which can be used to pinpoint and predict who will return products (e.g., age; Daunt and Harris 2012), or to provide evidence that strategically increasing the stringency of return policies will reduce returns (e.g., Petersen and Kumar 2010; Powers and Jack 2013). In contrast, the current research investigates whether a strict return policy is always in the best interest of the retailer. We investigate whether a lenient return policy can have a positive long-term impact on retailers by favorably influencing brand image and other related brand outcomes. Drawing on cue utilization theory, we study the influence of return policy stringency on retail brand image and consumer behavioral outcomes, such as willingness to pay and intentions to revisit a retailer. We test our hypotheses in an online experiment with 80 participants. We find empirical evidence that a lenient return policy was effective in increasing consumers’ brand image and trust, and that brand trust mediates the relationship between return policy stringency and brand image. As consumers’ brand trust increases, a lenient return policy improves brand image faster than a strict return policy. Further, a lenient return policy increased consumers’ intentions to purchase from the retailer, but may have no impact on the amount of money consumers spend, only increasing their likelihood of purchasing the brand when they know it is easy to return. For supply chain and brand managers, the results of this study reveal that the strictness of the return policy impacts more than the effort consumers exert to return products and the firm’s bottom line—the return policy also directly influences brand image, brand trust, and purchase intentions. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.",Behavioral intentions; Brand image; Brand trust; Product returns; Return policy,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125243577

Additionally, environmental regulations and customers' increasing expectations leave companies no choice but applying the return policy. In this regard, designing a supply chain network incorporating the reverse flow can provide environmental requirements in addition to economic objectives. In this paper, a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed for a closed-loop supply chain network (CLSCN) design. The proposed model is multi-period and multi-product that covers facility location and routing of heterogeneous vehicle fleets, simultaneously. The efficiency of the model is validated based on a real case in production and distribution chain of automotive spare parts manufacturing company in Iran.

Remanufacturing activities are typically carried out on products that have been returned by consumers, and the increasingly high flow of products spontaneously returned by customers through marketing initiatives such as Money-Back Guarantee policies, false warranty claims, or end of life returns, is a growing source of products that can be easily remanufactured. In this paper, we develop a novel pricing model for a firm that produces and sells Generation 1 new products in the first period with a promise of Money-Back Guarantee on returned products regardless of reasons. Products returned in the first period can be remanufactured and sold as remanufactured products during the second period, alongside Generation 2 new products. The firm needs to determine the optimal pricing for its two generations of new products and its remanufactured products, based on demand derived from its customers' utility of purchasing either the new or the remanufactured products. We identify the firm's optimal production strategy. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the key managerial insights derived from the model. This paper makes two contributions to the literature: 1) it links customer returns and closed loop supply chain management. Most studies on customer returns do not link remanufacturing with product returns, while most studies on closed loop supply chains assume that the source for remanufactured products is unlimited. 2) It is shown that although remanufacturing returned products may cannibalize new sales, it enhances overall sales, as the firm can differentiate prices for Generation 2 new products and remanufactured products in the second period to attract customers with different valuations on the products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Closed loop supply chain; Money-back guarantee; Pricing; Product returns; Refurbished products; Remanufacturing,Costs; Planning; Restoration; Supply chain management; Closed-loop supply chain; Money-back guarantee; Product returns; Refurbished products; Remanufacturing; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069895756

As an unfortunate side effect for retailers, empirical findings demonstrate that lenient return policies lead some customers to abuse those return policies through opportunistic and even fraudulent behaviors. Customers can abuse return policies by making purchases with the full intention of returning the products or by returning a product long after extracting most of the product's market value. In doing so, abusive customers extract utility—physical, experiential, or financial—from these purchases, at little or no cost to themselves. However, retailers incur significant costs from such return abuse, with estimates topping $5.6 billion annually in the United States alone. Identifying customers who perpetrate return abuse remains a critical topic. Yet, as a construct, return abuse is difficult to define and to quantify. In contrast, legitimate returner and nonreturner customers exhibit different return behaviors with distinctly different transactional behaviors and profitability outcomes. To investigate these diverse returner behaviors, this study empirically analyzes a transactional secondary data set of over 1 million customers with over 75 million transactions from a national U.S.-based retailer. The analysis generates empirical insights that characterize observable customer actions related to abusive returners, legitimate returners, and nonreturners. This study introduces a set of predictive models that enable actionable managerial intervention and presents the opportunity to recapture significant returns costs that might otherwise be lost to avoidable return abuse. The analysis also highlights the need for a more holistic perspective toward predicting, managing, and preventing returns. © 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",consumer returns; predictive analytics; return abuse,Consumer behavior; Cost benefit analysis; Data Analytics; Sales; Consumer return; Data analytics; Empirical findings; Market values; Predictive models; Product markets; Return abuse; Return policy; Secondary data sets; Side effect; Predictive analytics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081742188

We consider a situation where a retailer sells several products to the customer and orders the products from one supplier. Demands are assumed to be deterministic following an inventory-dependent demand, and the supplier offers all-units discount to the retailer who has an opportunity to return unsold or deteriorated products to the supplier at a certain cost. In order to minimize the total cost for the retailer, the decision variables are the optimal return time and the optimal ordering quantity. Considering a multi-item case as an extension of the model by Setiawan et al. (2018) is the main contribution of this paper. We also develop an algorithm to find the optimal solution of the model. Numerical examples for three items are given to illustrate the model and a sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of the changes in parameter values on the optimal solution. We consider two scenarios, one with all-units discount and one with no discount. Within these two scenarios, we consider conditions of individual or joint return time for these three items. It is found that the individual return time with no discount gives the least total inventory cost in the numerical examples. Also, in general increasing the value of holding cost, deteriorating rate, return cost per unit and backorder cost will increase the total inventory cost in all scenarios. © International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.",All-units discount; Joint return policy; Multi-item; Perishable inventory model,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081890826

At the same time, lacking the first-hand touching experience in online shopping often causes a utility mismatch to consumers, which may not only turn down some potential consumers but also cause a high return rate. A recent business practice for retailers is to encourage showrooming–consumers browsing product in the offline channel but switching to the online channel for purchases, with an aim to leverage both the low cost from the online channel and the real experience from the offline channel. We address such a dual-channel system with omni channels, i.e., concurrently running a mix of online and offline channels by a joint decision on pricing for the two channels as well as the associated return policy. Using an appropriate model we show that a well-designed dual-channel system can indeed increase the profitability of a retailer. Specifically, we find that channel cost difference is the key factor behind the rationale of encouraging showrooming. Retailers can intentionally create a channel price gap to facilitate demand shifting from offline channel to online channel, thus achieving considerable fulfilment cost savings as well as return cost savings. In addition, we reveal that return policy decision is closely related with pricing decisions, and show that return policy design can be viewed as a tool for market segmentation through modulating channel prices. Finally, we identify several barriers for retailers to engage with consumers directly such as consumer valuation uncertainty and cost efficiency of handling returns, and show that it may be beneficial for retailers to engage with consumers indirectly via consumer showrooming. © Operational Research Society 2019.",consumer returns; consumer strategic behaviour; Multi-channel management; pricing; valuation uncertainty,Electronic commerce; Sales; Appropriate models; Business practices; consumer returns; consumer strategic behaviour; Consumer valuations; Market segmentation; Multi channel managements; Pricing decision; Costs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066854232

The purpose of this paper is to provide an e-fulfillment performance evaluation framework for an e-tailer, considering the different performance aspects of information systems (IS), marketing and operations for e-tailers. Design/methodology/approach: Since quite a few performance aspects (i.e. IS, marketing system and operations) need to be factored in while evaluating the e-fulfillment performance, it may be considered as a complex multi-criteria decision-making problem. This study used decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) based analytic network process (DANP) to investigate the relationship between performance class and performance aspects, and calculated their weights.

The study compares a recoverable monetary scenario with conditions where money is either not spent or spent, but purchase and payment are decoupled. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 184 participants was utilised in three experiments. A randomised design was used, and experimental manipulations were achieved using the vignette method. Findings: The results indicate that consumers are susceptible to sunk-time fallacy. Specifically, results suggest that there is no significant difference in sunk cost fallacy when a consumer spends only time vs when a consumer spends money and time both but money can be recovered. The sunk-time fallacy did not occur in credit card purchases. The sunk-time fallacy did not happen in temporal investments of less than a week but appeared in the temporal investments of two weeks. Research limitations/implications: The study indicates that sunk-time fallacy occurs after a minimum threshold of time is spent on a particular activity. Practical implications: Online retailers may vary the delivery period of ordered merchandise to reduce product returns. Online retailers may not deliver the merchandise too early to take advantage of the sunk-time fallacy. Bestseller products should be quickly delivered as there are lesser chances of product return. On the other hand, new products or products with mixed consumer reviews should be provided preferably with a time lag beyond a week. Managers should incentivise payments through debit card/net banking and cash-on-delivery to reduce returns by using sunk-time fallacy. Originality/value: The study is perhaps the first one to study the sunk-time fallacy in a simultaneous variation of time and money where monetary costs can be recovered fully. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Credit; Product returns,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062664863

How to ensure the matching between product supply and market demand is particularly important for enterprises. Obtaining demand information in advance is helpful to achieve this goal. Considering the loss aversion of strategic consumers, this paper studies retailers' advance selling and return policies. Based on the behavioral characteristics of strategic and myopic consumers, a two-stage model of pre-sale and normal sales is constructed. This paper makes a comparative study on the two advance selling strategies of permitted return and non-permitted return. By constructing the profit model of retailers under the two strategies, the optimal pre-sale price and the optimal return price are obtained, and the corresponding range of return price is given. It is found that the retailer has to lower price for pre-sale products because of loss aversion among strategic consumers. When the return price after the end of the presale period is not higher than a specific value, the implementation of the return strategy can enable the retailer to obtain a better return, and there is an optimal return price. It makes the expected profit of the retailer reach the maximum under the return mode. © 2019, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

That's why a survey and individual interviews have held with apparel supply chain professionals in order to focus on these factors and construct the relationship among them through simulation and modeling using a system dynamic approach. The results have revealed that the product variety, lead time, return policy and quality levels affected dramatically the supply chain profit under mass customization.

If the majority of people understand the importance of test and the risk of poor test equipment maintenance, why is test usually the last to be thought about, underfunded, delayed, and usually blamed for all that goes wrong with a project? With the increased density of components, tighter tolerances/margins, shorter time to market, and the ever focus on cost reduction, the strategy for developing, building, deploying, and maintaining test has not really changed. It's time to start looking at test basics and building strategies that work to enhance a program, rather than becoming an obstacle.

Test has shown it can reduce time to develop products, reduce the cost of building products, and enhance support program capabilities.

It will look at the best traditional test strategy techniques and new tactics, including aspects of Industry 4.0.

Three scenarios, depending on whether buyback contracts are offered to neither, one, or both of the retailers, are considered. We first study the case when the manufacturer can only determine his buyback price. We show how the demand uncertainty, the competition level and the handling cost of buyback contract influence the profits of the manufacturer, the two retailers and the whole supply chain. Interestingly, contrary to the conventional wisdom that the buyback contract may intensify competition between the retailers, we show that offering the buyback contract to two competing retailers can benefit every channel member even if the competition level is high. Next, we study the return contract, a special type of buyback contract, and show the effect of competition level and industry outlook on supply chain parties' choices on return contract. We extend Padmanabhan and Png [1997. “Manufacturer's Returns Policies And Retail Competition.” Marketing Science 16 (1): 81–94] to the case with an asymmetric contract structure, i.e. one return contract and one whole-sale contract.

However, it remains unclear whether and how VFR influences sales and post-sales outcomes based on the limited literature, and retailers hesitate in adopting the technology due to concerns about its profit prospects. In this research, we conduct two large-scale field experiments to test the causal effects of different VFR designs, and a lab experiment to unveil the underlying theoretical mechanisms. We find that, although VFR can have a sizeable positive effect on sales, it can be counterproductive when used improperly. Specifically, personalized VFR may not increase sales if used in combination with conventional product visualizations because self-discrepancy becomes salient under this condition. Moreover, VFR significantly influences post-sales outcomes, i.e., it enhances customer satisfaction and reduces product return rate. The findings provide distinct theoretical contributions and managerial implications. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",customer satisfaction; online sales; product returns; virtual fitting room; virtual reality,Customer satisfaction; Virtual reality; Conventional products; Managerial implications; Online retailing; Online sales; Product returns; Self discrepancies; virtual fitting room; Virtual reality technology; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070256507

There are two separate customer demands for the new product with two-period remaining lifetime and the old product with one-period remaining lifetime, and a fixed proportion of the unsatisfied demand for one product will purchase the other product as a substitute. One distinctive feature of our system is that a random portion of the sold new product is returned and can be remanufactured and remarketed as the old product for sale. The objective is to maximize the expected total discounted profit over a finite planning horizon. We show that the optimal remanufacturing policy is a modified base–stock policy, and that the optimal manufacturing quantity of the new product decreases in the inventory level of the old product after remanufacturing. Furthermore, when the inventory level of the old product is large, the optimal manufacturing quantity asymptotically approaches a constant, which is lower and upper bounded by two newsvendor fractile solutions. We also conduct a numerical study to derive insights into the effects of remanufacturing and demand substitution. In particular, we show that remanufacturing can be a powerful way of mitigating negative environmental impacts in the cut flower industry.

By considering imperfect correlation, we observe that intrinsic variations of returns may dramatically deteriorate the operational performance of these closed-loop supply chains. To cope with such added complexity, we propose a structure for controlling the reverse flow through the recoverable stock. The developed mechanism, in the form of a prefilter, is designed to leverage the known positive consequences of the deterministic component of the returns and to buffer the harmful impact of their stochastic component. We show that this outperforms both the benchmark push system and a baseline solution consisting of regulating all the returns. Consequently, we demonstrate that the operation of the production system is greatly smoothed and inventory is better managed. By developing a new framework for measuring the dynamics of closed-loop supply chains, we show that a significant reduction in the net stock, manufacturing, and remanufacturing variances can be achieved, which undoubtedly has implications both for stock reduction and production stabilization. Thus, the known benefits of circular economy models are strengthened, both economically and environmentally. © 2019 The Author(s)",Closed-loop supply chains; Control engineering; Inventory; Remanufacturing; System dynamics,Control engineering; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Deterministic component; Inventory; Operational performance; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing system; Stochastic component; System Dynamics; Manufacture,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065528768

The organization and the management of these activities are primordial for the proper functioning of the chain. In fact, the supply chain management consists of restructuring the flows while optimizing the costs as much as possible. Nowadays, the world is interested in the reverse supply chain which includes the product returns and their disposition. But the integration of the reverse flow in the supply chain complicates more the functioning of the system. In this paper, we focus on studying the inventory control for a system which includes remanufacturing in a production system. We consider a hybrid manufacturing-remanufacturing system performed by a single machine for two types of demands. The demands of remanufactured and new products are fulfilled from separated stocks. Three types of stocks for returned, remanufactured, and new products exist independently. Both, manufacturing and remanufacturing are executed by a single machine that is subject to random failures and repairs. All returned products are accepted and supplied by a collection center and no disposal option is allowed. The performance of the system model is evaluated by studying the effect of the stocks level threshold on the long term average global costs using discrete-event simulation and then validated using comparison with a regression model. © 2019 IEEE.",ANOVA; Inventory control; Manufacturing; Regression; Remanufacturing; Simulation; Stochastic,Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Discrete event simulation; Inventory control; Manufacture; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Production system; Regression; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing system; Reverse supply chains; Simulation; Stochastic; Stochastic inventory model; Supply chain management,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076021195

ROI calculations compare the estimated profits from a product to the investments necessary to get the product developed, approved and marketed. Risk factors are incorporated into the ROI, which consider multiple factors including competitor products and market demand. ROI calculations enables a company to set and apply metrics for the evaluation of projects that can be applied consistently, across a portfolio, and goes beyond simple profitability assessments. When coupled with additional financial tools and strategic evaluations such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis, ROI can provide invaluable and comparable insight into the value of potential projects and products. Here, we present a framework for executing ROI calculations to enable investment or termination decisions for research and development projects. This is augmented with insight on how to apply the framework to academic, government and NGO evaluations where ‘profits’ are not always measured in purely economic terms.

For instance, a retailer should sell more products by offering ""20% off, plus an extra 25% off” than by offering an economically equivalent single discount of ""40% off.” We conduct multimethodology research to investigate a potential downside of offering stacked discounts: Can stacked discounts disproportionately increase retailer costs from product returns? We incorporate insights from prior behavioral work and develop an analytical model to generate predictions about how stacked discounts affect retail sales and return performance. Next, we conduct a laboratory experiment to provide evidence for our theory in a controlled environment. Subsequently, we empirically test our predictions under real market conditions using six-year transactional data from promotional events at a national jewelry retailer. Finally, drawing upon the empirical estimates, we conduct a numerical study to assess the impact of stacked discounts on retail profitability. Our analytical model and the empirical results identify the inherent tradeoffs associated with stacked discounts and demonstrate the cost structures under which stacked discounts will decrease firm profitability despite an increase in initial sales. We conclude by discussing implications for retailers in assessing the impact of how they frame their price discounts. © 2019 INFORMS.",Framing effect; Pricing; Product returns; Stacked discounts,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066028940

One important result is that when the retailer's cost of handling returns is within a certain range, the profits of the supplier and O2O supply chain in the duopoly context (Model D) are higher than those in the monopoly context (Model O). However, regardless of the retailer cost of handling returns, an e-retailer's profits are always higher than the sum of the two retailers' profits. For consumer surplus, when the retailer's cost of handling returns meets certain conditions, the consumer surplus is lower in the monopoly context (Model O) than in the duopoly context (Model D) and creates more utility for consumers in a duopolistic market. The research is beneficial for companies seeking to establish sound pricing and sales strategies in the emerging field of O2O commerce, enhancing companies' long-term economic performance. © 2013 IEEE.",Channel distribution; Internet marketing; O2O supply chain; pricing decision; product returns,Commerce; Competition; Decision making; Profitability; Sales; Supply chain management; Channel distributions; Competitive marketplace; Different distributions; Economic performance; Internet marketing; Pricing decision; Product returns; Selling strategies; Costs,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077237807

Battery of electricity vehicle, rental service of DVD, construction equipment, cellphone, bestseller book, style costume and camera in tourist area are examples of rental perishable items with a fixed shelf life and recycling characteristic. Mainly taking battery swap station of electricity vehicles for example, this paper attempts to gain an insight into the role of return policy in rental perishable supply chain from the perspective of supplier. Under the condition of rental demand uncertainty, the supplier faces issue of how to maximize expected profit through return policy. Therefore, a bilateral monopoly model is developed to address this question. This paper illustrates that return policy tends to ensure system optimal for rental perishable supply chain as long as battery supplier choose appropriate wholesale price and buyback price. Moreover, return policy can achieve channel coordination and both parties benefit from the win–win situation under certain condition. It is possible for battery supplier to arbitrarily distribute the incremental profit of return policy by appropriately choosing values of wholesale price and buyback price. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Micro-grid; Random variables; Rental perishables; Uncertain demand,Construction equipment; Electronic Waste; Profitability; Random variables; Recycling; Supply chains; Battery swap stations; Channel coordination; Demand uncertainty; Micro grid; Perishable commodities; Rental perishables; Uncertain demand; Whole sale prices; Secondary batteries,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053844036

We study the impact of this strategy on prices and profits of retailers. We build a model based on a Hotelling line where a retailer manages both the store and online channel in the presence of customers' strategic shopping behavior. We use customers' expectation utility to classify their choices. After BOPS is implemented, customers may choose to buy online directly, buy in the store directly or buy online pickup in store. For customers is uncertain whether the product is a good match, a part of customers who buy online directly will return it. When customers return the product, there is a loss to the retailer. We prove that BOPS can help the retailer gain higher profits under certain conditions. Then a revenue-sharing mechanism is proposed to allocate profits of the decentralized channels with BOPS. Besides, the loss of product returns may be reduced after the coordination is achieved. In a word, BOPS is a good way for retailers to draw customers to the store and make more profits. Even in a decentralized retail system where store and online channels are managed separately, a revenue-sharing mechanism can be designed to share the revenue across channels to mitigate channel conflicts and increase the profit of the whole supply chain. © 2019 IEEE.",Buy-online-and-picku-in-store; Game theroy; Pricing; Strategic customer behavior,Costs; Pickups; Profitability; Supply chains; Buy-online-and-picku-in-store; Customers' expectations; Game theroy; Pricing strategy; Product returns; Revenue-sharing; Shopping behavior; Strategic customer behaviors; Sales,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074885891

Allowing unsatisfactory online purchases to be cross-returned to the physical store together with same-channel returns is one of the practical strategies used in the dual-channel retailing industry. Many of those returns are intact and undamaged and, thus, can be resold. But there is a lack of the research on how those resalable returns impact the order quantities of each channel. In this paper we study and compare four different return policies where a dual-channel retailer offers both same- and cross-channel returns. For each return policy, we propose mathematical models to determine optimal order quantities that account for the impact of resalable returns.

This paper studies the optimal pricing decisions in a dual-channel supply chain (SC) —consists of a manufacturer and a retailer— under different government intervention policies, namely ES, revenue seeking, social welfare, and sustainable development. We develop an extended dual-channel SC model under flexible return policies, including full-refund via the direct (i.e., manufacturer) channel, the indirect (i.e., retailer) channel, and both direct and indirect channels. A dynamic multi-level Stackelberg game approach is used to examine the SC interactions and characterize the return strategy, optimal pricing, and ES level decisions under different scenarios. The results show that employing full-refund via the indirect channel policy under price incentive schemes not only maximizes the profit of dual-channel SC but also satisfies the government's objective functions. In contrast to other intervention policies, the revenue seeking policy does not necessarily improve the social welfare and energy saving level unless the government budget is increased. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Dual-channel supply chain; Energy-saving regulation; Flexible return policy; Government intervention; Multi-level game theory; Pricing policies,Budget control; Costs; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Game theory; Manufacture; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Dual channel supply chain; Energy-saving regulations; Government intervention; Multilevels; Pricing policy; Return policy; Public policy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067868354

We first develop an optimal stopping model where the defect rate is a beta random variable that is constant across all periods. We solve the problem using stochastic dynamic programming (DP) and develop thresholds for optimal stopping based on the observed value of the number of returns as a state variable. We then extend the model where the beta defect rate random variable is revised using Bayesian updating in each period after observing the number of product returns from the preceding period. Employing the conjugate property of the beta and binomial, we again solve the problem as a stochastic DP and determine the thresholds based on the values of the state vector with three variables. We show that for the more general version, the computational difficulty increases dramatically with problem size. For this problem we present a simulation optimization approach that selects the best functional form for the threshold curve.

One way to tackle this challenge is to demystify the multi-faceted uncertainties of product returns namely timing, volume and quality, that currently inhibit optimality of reverse logistics networks (RLN). One contributor to this risk is the uncertainty in the quality level of used electronics caused by variations in consumer usage behaviors. It would be useful if businesses could have data about the expected quality levels of future returns for efficient planning of RLN design and resource allocation. The objective of this thesis is to develop a quantitative model that can estimate the return quality of future electronics returns. The applicability of this model lies in enabling reprocessors to strategically design an RLN with the optimal number, capacity and location of the necessary facilities, with the aim of reducing the risks of costly investments, while facilitating RLNs that are both, environmentally and economically viable. While significant literature on forecast of volume and timing of returned products exists, there is scare work on forecasting of return quality. Additionally, significant literature explores the use of IoT, RFID and prognostic health monitoring (PHM) systems, characteristic of Industry 4.0, as a method of using life cycle data to predict return quality. However, it can be argued that these costly methods can only be justified for products with long life spans. As an alternative for short-lived products, this thesis develops a forecast model for return quality based on consumer behavior trends. The proposed forecast model incorporates three major factors that affect quality: usage, technological age, and remaining economic value of expected returns. The novelty of the model lies in deducing usage distributions through segmentation of the consumers by three socioeconomic factors: age, income, and location. These usage distributions are used to estimate remaining life of returns, the associated recovery costs and the subsequent profitability based on economic market trends. Firstly, the methodology involves establishing a correlation between relevant socioeconomic factors and smartphone usage behaviors through statistical tests of association. To this end, empirical data from surveys has been used to derive trends between the response variables, smartphone usage and purchase behavior, and the independent variables, which are the socioeconomic factors. Secondly, a complex system of equations is developed incorporating usage level and time-based secondary market value trends of the product. They determine the most feasible quality level of a unit based on expected profit that can be derived from it through the streams of direct reuse, refurbishing, parts harvest, or materials recycling. For demonstration of the model, a random sample of smartphone returns based on consumers in Canada, generated using Monte Carlo Methods, is input into the forecast model to predict the output-which is the distribution of return quality from the collections in Canadian cities. The results of this thesis can be used by original equipment manufacturers, government or third party reprocessors, to design a more efficient RLN by providing them information on what quality levels to expect from the used smartphones. © 2019, IEOM Society International.",Forecast; Return quality; Reverse logistics; Smartphones; Socioeconomic trends,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079284250

E-tailers employ two mitigating measures. First, returns management affects the number of returns via restocking fees and hassle cost; a restrictive policy leads to fewer returns but also depresses demand. Second, salvaging increases e-tailers’ revenue via the resale of returned items. We unite these two and analyze how to most profitably allocate returns to different salvaging channels and how this depends on and influences the returns policy, price, as well as profit. A competitive retailer must adopt a smart salvaging approach while simultaneously setting the price and restocking fee. The result is a profit-maximizing portfolio of salvage opportunities—which includes the primary market, the secondary market, and returns to the manufacturer (RTM)—as applied by highly profitable e-tailers such as Zalando. Yet in reality, most e-tailers salvage returns exclusively in the primary market; that strategy is suboptimal because it reduces profits and yields a too-strict returns policy. The alternative, smart salvaging policy reduces both price and restocking fee but still increases profit. Such a policy requires that managers respond dynamically: new competition calls for more salvaging of returns by RTM; increased market concentration calls for salvaging more in the primary and secondary markets. Products with a longer (resp., shorter) selling time are more profitably salvaged in the primary market (resp., via RTM). A firm’s investment in salvaging opportunities will not pay off unless these considerations are taken into account. We derive implications for e-tailers and recommend managerial strategies for remaining competitive. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Pricing; Restocking Fees; Returns Management; Salvaging; Secondary Markets,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089912069

Although online shopping provides time and place utility to consumers, it is does not allow consumers to touch or try on products before purchase. For this reason, product returns in online channels are much higher than the returns in physical channels. Compared to physical channels, it takes longer time to process online return claims, because there is usually no physical location for consumers to directly return products to. They often need to use carrier companies, which increases process duration. Hence, online consumers who make return claim are often inconvenienced by long waiting times, even if their return claim is accepted. In order to address these idiosyncratic difficulties of online shopping, this paper suggests a photo-enabled order tracking system that allows consumers to visualize photos of their orders over the Internet at each e-fulfilment step. This system is proposed to provide two advantages. First, the audit function in e-fulfilment process is partially delegated to consumers, who, if they desire, can monitor their orders, enabling errors to be corrected instantly. This monitoring mechanism would decrease the firms' use of internal resources necessary to control logistics processes to prevent the possible instances of consumer dissatisfaction. Second, although the instant correction may not be possible, the return process would be shorter, because consumers will be able to make their return claims before the product is delivered to the delivery point. This would provide a saving in both the logistics costs of firms and the time-period that consumers need to wait for possessing products physically in the right form. In order to support these propositions, this paper has made a content analysis of the negative text comments posted by online consumers in an e-marketplace. After the identification of major reasons for product return claims with this analysis, this paper discusses how the photo-enabled order tracking system might help address and even eliminate the causes of online return claims. This paper also discusses the operational challenges and limitations of using this system for firms. © 2019 IEEE.",e-fulfilment; logistics information technology; order tracking; product return management; reverse logistics,Electronic commerce; Image enhancement; Tracking (position); Logistics information; Monitoring mechanisms; Operational challenges; Order tracking; Physical locations; Product return management; Return managements; Reverse logistics; Supply chain management,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076033715

This solution applied at Alibaba achieves more than 80% precision while covering 44% more suspicious accounts compared with a previously deployed rule-based classifier after human expert investigations. Our approach can easily and effectively generalizes to other types of insurance. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To facilitate the remanufacturing of used product returns, factors which affect remanufacturability should be considered during the product design stage. The selection of fastening method during the product design stage is one of the critical decisions which affects the remanufacturability as well as the total cost of disassembly and re-assembly of used products. Hence, both product assembly and disassembly issues should be considered in the product design stage for the selection of fastening methods. Simultaneous consideration of product assembly and disassembly in the product design stage for the fastening method selection has not been properly addressed in previous studies. In this paper, a methodology for selecting appropriate fastening method from a remanufacturing perspective is proposed in which both product assembly and disassembly are addressed. In the proposed methodology, an optimization model is formulated with the objective of minimizing the total cost of product assembly and disassembly. The genetic algorithm is employed to solve the model. A case study on the selection of fastening method for a laptop computer is conducted to illustrate the proposed methodology and to evaluate its effectiveness. The effect of the degree of product disassembly and the demand size for remanufactured products on the total cost of product assembly and disassembly was also investigated. The results showed the proposed methodology provide significant cost savings in the total product assembly and disassembly cost. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Design for assembly; Design for disassembly; End-of-life products; Fastener selection; Genetic algorithm,Ecodesign; Genetic algorithms; Laptop computers; Product design; Design for assembly; End-of-life products; Fastening method; Optimization modeling; Product assembly; Product recovery; Remanufacturability; Remanufactured products; Assembly,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057071716

Based on three scenario experiments, the paper addresses the effects of salesperson interaction quality and other tactics aimed at increasing buying intention. The findings indicate that high interaction quality increases showroomers' in-store buying intention – even when a salesperson matches the online price. The salesperson suggesting an alternative product or explaining the store's return policy also appear to be effective tactics to increase buying intentions. Interestingly, showroomers and non-showroomers reacted similarly to these strategies, indicating that the tactics can work for both parties. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Consumer behavior; Interaction quality; Salesperson behavior; Showrooming,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066241510

Design/methodology/approach: A multiple case study was conducted involving 12 e-commerce firms and 4 logistics service providers. An integrative data collection approach of semi-structured interviews, documentation and observations was used to gain comprehensive managerial and operational descriptions of returns management (RM) processes. Findings: The findings show inconsistent RM processes, with a plethora of practices implemented and organised differently across firms. RM processes are ambiguous; their design is a result of incremental changes over time, lacking strategy and goals. There is a mismatch between how they are described and understood in the literature and how they are actually used. Practices in gatekeeping, avoidance and reverse logistics are defined and categorised. These serve as a typology of practices for managers to (re)consider, along with 15 propositions on how RM is practised. Research limitations/implications: The range of RM practices and the processes reflect a lack of scholarly attention and strategic view. Research is needed to develop clear goals on how the RM process can be better aligned with business strategies. Practical implications: The typology of practices is a benchmark for internet retailers in their design of efficient RM processes. Originality/value: Systematic and empirical research on RM is scarce compared to forward management. The study bridges this gap as one of the first to describe RM practices in depth, define service as a key activity, and identify a mismatch between theory and practice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Avoidance; Case study; Consumer returns; Gatekeeping; Internet retailing; Returns management; Reverse logistics; Service,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070265839

Design/methodology/approach: Understanding of feedback concept for the purpose of product returns avoidance management and its linkages with knowledge management through the theoretical review was performed first. Second, soft systems methodology (SSM) to analyze the very complex situation, as the product returns present, provided the conceptual framework for empirical research.

In this study we analyze the impact of situational factors (1. Purchase channel choice, 2. Time pressure) and individual differences on product uncertainty and purchase decision reversal. Following the conceptualization of product uncertainty by Hong and Pavlou (2014), we distinguish between product fit uncertainty and product quality uncertainty. To test our hypotheses, we employ a large-scale empirical analysis based on panel data from a large European online fashion retailer. We find that product fit uncertainty is higher for mobile channel users, which is attenuated by prior brand experience.

We leverage data on a large retailer’s launch of a mobile app and use a difference-in-differences approach.

Furthermore, app adopters’ purchases in both the online and offline channels increase after app launch. The time, location, and features of app use provide descriptive evidence of how the app aids shopping in other channels.

Optimizing supply chain performance is a primary concern of manufacturing and logistics organizations. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is helping organizations to build automated and interconnected smart environment by object identification and tracking, motivating the first step towards an IoT-enabled world. This chapter attempts to understand extant literature studying applications of RFID in implementing the IoT in supply chain management. We categorize extant literature, firstly, based on research methodology and secondly, based on supply chain processes. We find that presently academic activity is around conceptualizing the usability of RFID in the IoT with limited analytical and empirical evidence. Supply chain processes such as demand planning, procurement, retail shelf space management and product returns are prospective areas for interesting future research. © 2020 by IGI Global.

However, the absence of voluntary take-back for relocation to needy markets limits the benefits of reverse logistics for sustainability practices in India. Production planning and RL design without taking product category and feedback into consideration are ineffective. Resulting in a pressing need to devise policies by incorporating economic costs, environmental costs, and effective product returns in the model aimed at sustainability through RL. This article demonstrates how the principles of Taguchi's Orthogonal Arrays can be applied in a system dynamics model highlighting the presence of two brand categories (preferred & un-preferred) and their respective RL processes that substantially influences product shelf life, maximum allowable sales loss, and delays in the reverse logistics process. The contributions of this research are: (i) market flooding of expired stock can be alleviated for longer shelf life and preferred brands by increasing marketing efforts. (ii) Increasing safety stocks helps sales in a dynamic market but does not alleviate market flooding. (iii) Due to the absence of feedback between reverse and forward logistics processes, improvements in reverse logistics attributes like product return and claims processing delays do not impact sales rather it alleviates market flooding. The medicine take-back policies in India need to be sensitive to the category of the product. There is also a potential for placing checks on the supply side to alleviate market flooding, and a need to provide feedback between reverse and forward logistics through risk-sharing agreements in order to enable product take-back for both disposal and relocation to needy markets. The possible research extensions include the structural changes in the proposed model to test RL, for sustainability policies and the study of brand/product level competition. © 2018",Brand differentiation; Design of experiments; Pharmaceuticals industry; Reverse logistics; Sustainability; System dynamics,Commerce; Design of experiments; Floods; Product design; Production control; Risk management; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; System theory; Pharmaceutical industry; Pharmaceuticals industry; Reverse logistics; Risk sharing agreement; Sustainability policy; Sustainability practices; System Dynamics; Taguchi's orthogonal arrays; Logistics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056185258

In the beginning, the stationary joint distribution is obtained in the product form for the queue length and the on-hand inventory level. Additionally, the resulting distribution is applied to derive some performance measures, which can be adopted to numerically calculate the optimal (s, S) policy.

We simultaneously looked at the pro rata warranty and free replacement/repair warranty policies and assumed that customers can choose the desired policy. A return policy for an online distributor was also included and two objective functions were used to address the problem. The first objective function maximized the total expected revenue, and the second objective function maximized customer satisfaction.

Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology used in this research is a combination of concept mapping, and the extension of the work of other researchers (deductive approach) to develop a RCF that connects tools, techniques, systems and RL processes. Findings: This research shows that by integrating tools, systems, tools and techniques with RL processes by means of the RCF will increase performance and productivity of a RL operations. This is demonstrated by applying the RCF to a consumer electronics business that proves that the time taken for the end to end RL operations is reducred by 2020. Research limitations/implications: The RCF has been demonstrated with the data from a consumer electronics organisation. Literature points out that there are many different mathematical models for RL across a number of industries. Thus, at this stage, it is not clear if the RCF developed in this research will work in other industries, such as the newspaper, plastic bottles and online retailers industry where product returns are high. This research work can be extended in developing an IT solution by future researchers that can be linked to the main ERP system of an organisation. Practical implications: SC managers can use the RCF in the extended form of an IT solution to manage the RL operations of their organisations. Originality/value: There is a lack of research in the space of reverse collaboration in the broader field of SC management.

The manufacturer decides whether to implement a return policy in either the direct or indirect channel, or in both channels. When the return policy is provided, the cost of returned products has to be covered by the corresponding channel. We consider four possible strategies, including full refund in the direct channel only, full refund in the indirect channel only, full refund in both channels, and no refund in both channels. Given the equilibrium pricing strategies of firms, the preferences of firms over different strategies are determined by comparisons between the anticipated return rate of customers and their perceived value of the return policy. The manufacturer prefers the full-refund policy in both channels when the return rate of the customer is low. Otherwise, the dominant strategy for the manufacturer is the no-refund policy in both channels. The retailer benefits more from the full-refund policy in the indirect channel alone when the return rate is low; otherwise, the retailer prefers the full-refund policy in the direct channel only. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Direct channel; Game theory; Indirect channel; Perceived value of return policy; Return policy,Costs; Game theory; Manufacture; Supply chains; Direct channel; Dominant strategy; Dual channel supply chain; Equilibrium pricing; Indirect channel; Refund policies; Return policy; Strategic effect; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023606904

However, the manufacturer must still maintain sufficient inventory to satisfy customer warranty claims in the future. We study the spare parts inventory control problem under such a setting, where remanufacturing parts from product returns is adopted as the main approach to ensure sufficient supply. One novel feature of our model is the interrelationships among the installed base, product returns, and demand for spare parts, which lead to the endogeneity of demand. Specifically, we formulate stochastic dynamic programs for two scenarios, in which a firm either utilizes phase-out returns or proactively collects products. For the former scenario, we establish the optimality of a modified-base stock policy, and find that the inventory control target increases with the installed base size and part failure rate. For the latter scenario, we discover that a return-dependent base stock policy is optimal and conduct comparative static analyses for the acquisition and remanufacturing decisions, where their one-sided limited sensitivities in state variables (initial parts inventory and installed base size) are identified in a stationary environment. These findings are largely attributed the novel model with endogenous spare parts demand. Through extensive numerical studies, we investigate the benefits introduced by acquiring returns under a range of parameter settings. It is found that when the mismatch between warranty demand and part supply is higher, firms can enjoy more significant cost savings. Finally, the potential monetary loss when the relationships among the installed base, demand, and product returns are ignored is examined computationally. The extra cost incurred is significant and becomes higher when proactive acquisition is adopted. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",End-of-life problem; Inventory management; Product acquisition; Remanufacturing; Spare parts; Warranty,Customer satisfaction; Failure analysis; Inventory control; Mergers and acquisitions; Obsolescence; Static analysis; Stochastic systems; End of lives; Inventory management; Product acquisition; Remanufacturing; Spare parts; Warranty; Life cycle,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068063005

Influencing customers in their channel choices can result in reduced costs to serve customers and increased revenue. To achieve this, comprehensive omni-channel customer management is necessary that also includes fulfillment processes during the customer journey. Operations plays a key role in omni-channel retailing as it is in direct contact with customers and does not end at the store like for bricks-and-mortar retailing. Omni-channel retailing and in particular customer management with fulfillment options is a new topic in practice and constitutes a new research area. The contribution of this paper lies in building a bridge between sales and operations between online and physical store retailing. We develop propositions that demonstrate how customers can be guided through the channels. We use an exploratory study where data are collected mainly from face-to-face interviews with 25 omni-channel retailers. The objectives of the research include identifying fulfillment-related customer management opportunities via multiple channels used by retailers, assessing the relationships and interdependencies of the customer management methods, and developing propositions for omni-channel customer management. The management options are related to questions such as how customers can collect availability information across channels, how purchase and payment processes are designed, how delivery speed and costs are defined, and which return options are possible. Findings include, among others, that retailers use product availability checks for guiding customers into the store, prioritize certain operational actions, and prevent product returns. If executed in the right way, omni-channel customer management will not only result in differentiation and cross-selling potential for retailers, but also in additional benefit for customers. © The Author(s) 2019.",Customer management; Exploratory study; Omni-channel retailing; Retail,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072735952

The random demands could be non-stationary, evolving and correlated over time. For each model, we first establish the optimality of generalized base-stock policies, and then propose a new approximation algorithm that admits a worst-case performance guarantee of 2. The core concept developed in this study is called the delayed forced holding and production cost, which is proven effective in dealing with service level constrained inventory systems.

To demonstrate compliance with these requirements new and more accurate evaluation methods are needed. Thermal fatigue life in EGR coolers for heavy duty diesel applications have historically been a critical focus for engine OEMs. Being able to accurately evaluate product return rates due to thermal fatigue failures gives the OEM confidence that all end users will be satisfied, and allows program management to properly make fiscal decisions. Additionally, weight and cost optimization can be conducted with greater confidence. This is accomplished by accounting for product variation and application variation in thermal fatigue life evaluations. Including these variations requires a simplified numerical method to calculate product life, as tens of thousands of samples will be run through the analysis to represent real life random variation. First, time dependent component temperatures are calculated based on engine conditions. The component temperatures are used to determine strain, which is then used to evaluate thermal fatigue life. Appling this life calculation method to individual application duty cycles or all duty cycles allows field return schedules to be calculated. This method has been proven to accurately evaluate warranty return trends by studying a legacy EGR cooler, which has sufficient field experience. It was also found that specific application thermal fatigue life can be different than the thermal fatigue life of the entire fleet.

Drawing on cognitive dissonance theory and the e-commerce literature on reputation, we developed a research model that incorporates four types of pricing-oriented web technologies, seller reputation and product returns. Specifically, we posit that four common and popular types of pricing-oriented web technologies (i.e., limited time discount, price bundling, shop VIP, and quantity discount) impact product returns differentially. These relationships vary depending on seller reputation, manifested as an overall rating.

In such an environment, where sustainability concerns and awareness of environmental responsibility in industrial production has considerably grown, reverse logistics (RL) becomes more relevant and, thus, its correct management using suitable information systems (IS) is fundamental. Nevertheless, today's IS in general, and in Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) in particular, are developed based on conventional logistic processes that do not contemplate the specific characteristics of RL. The main objective of this work is to analyze the functional requirements of an IS to manage product recovery processes that serve as a guide to develop a suitable ERP for RL. The research methodology has been conducted with a qualitative approach, through which the main specific requirements that an IS must meet to manage RL have been stablished, and a data model for the development of solutions to the requirements identified in an ERP system has been proposed.

However, simulations are often limited in their ability to support real-time business decisions in complex fast changing environments due to the cost and time required to build, update and maintain simulation models. Remanufacturing operations in particular could benefit from the use of simulations as a tool to support the assessment of different strategies to real-time scenarios due to the uncertain nature of product returns. This research develops a data-driven simulation approach to predict material flow behaviour within remanufacturing operations, by utilising data from digital manufacturing systems (i.e. databases, traceability systems, process plans) to update and automatically modify the simulation constructs to reflect the real world or planned system. A data-driven simulation is proposed comprising of three elements: (i) an adaptive remanufacturing simulation algorithm to model the complex material flow found within a remanufacturing process in a generic and reusable way, (ii) a remanufacturing information model to structure and highlight the simulation data requirements and (iii) an information service layer to collect and analyse sensor data for use within the simulation. The simulation is implemented to demonstrate how it can automatically reconfigure and adapt to changes within the data inputs (process and factory models) using a case study of operations from a Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) remanufacturer, utilising data collected from a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) traceability system installed within the remanufacturing facility. © 2018",Data-driven simulation; Discrete event simulation; Industry 4.0; Operations management; Remanufacturing,Discrete event simulation; Electronic Waste; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Information services; Manufacture; Oscillators (electronic); Production control; Data-driven simulation; Digital manufacturing systems; Maintenance decisions; Manufacturing environments; Operations management; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing process; Waste electrical and electronic equipment; Radio frequency identification (RFID),Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057063260

We present a novel application of a closed-loop supply chain where product returns from demonstrations of high-end IT equipment are substantial and the major delay in the system is due to the long demonstration time at the client sites. In addition, the product lifecycle is short and the value erodes rapidly over time, with steep drops in the resale revenue when new product generations are introduced. We present a finite lifecycle model that captures the key trade-offs in this environment, that is, either to reuse a collected ex-demo product for a next demonstration or to salvage its residual value in the secondary market and use a new product to satisfy the next demo request. We derive two cost/revenue signals that enable us to distinguish between fast and slow value erosion. We show that the fast/slow erosion decision is dynamic and depends on the rate of value erosion and the length of the demonstration time. We analyze the optimal demo pool strategies and show that in the case of fast erosion it may be better to postpone reuse activities until later in the lifecycle. We illustrate our model using empirical data from a large IT manufacturer and formulate several guidelines so as to better manage high value ex-demonstration product returns. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Continuous time transportation problem application; Ex-demonstration product returns; Reuse closed-loop supply chains; Supply Chain Management; Time-sensitivity,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Demonstrations; Economic and social effects; Erosion; Manufacture; Sales; Supply chain management; Closed-loop supply chain; Novel applications; Product generation; Product returns; Product-life-cycle; Secondary market; Time sensitivity; Transportation problem; Life cycle,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062425679

Monitoring of wastes can lead to efficient policies and implementation of proactive measures for waste reduction. Up-to-date methods for waste monitoring in cyclic economy (CE)may not provide reliable and useful figures. Product stock-in-use and flows in CE, including waste flows, are uncertain due to varying demand and imports/exports, random, early losses of stock-in-use, delayed and distributed product returns or end-of-life exit and varying utilization of returns by remanufacturers. Adopting a systems perspective and using a dynamic/stochastic model of stock and flows in CE, this work quantifies waste monitoring and reduction under realistic conditions. It reveals how consumption and stock depletion consist the driving forces of waste generation, compensated by cyclic actions, reuse/remanufacturing and recycle. The conventional recycling rate and other key parameters, including the reuse rate, the mean lifetime, the remanufacturing rate, the number of reuse cycles, are shown inapt to accurately monitor end-wastes. None can consistently distinguish the environmentally superior system or state, featuring lower end-wastes. Higher recycling rates and/or higher reuse rates may not ensure lower wastes. Asymmetric policies (differing recycle and reuse rates)can be advantageous: higher reuse is preferable under rising stock and higher recycle under stock depletion. Sharp real-time monitoring of end-wastes is provided by the cycle rate, a dimensionless rate accounting for consumption and stock variations in CE.

For accurately evaluating the trustworthiness of sellers in their transactions, a new computational reputation model is proposed, which considers the buyer credibility. The credibility of a buyer is further determined by the buyer's subjectivity and his/her behavior in returning products. The buyer subjectivity in our paper not only reflects the difference between the buyer's rating and the average rating, but also reflects the fluctuation of the ratings provided by the buyer himself/herself. The product return behavior can directly indicate whether the buyer is satisfied with the goods they purchased or not. It has been shown that the profit-maximized equilibrium in the proposed system can be achieved, where sellers behave honestly in providing products and buyers not return the received products. Theoretical analysis and simulation based experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed reputation model can well evaluate the sellers' behavior and the proposed system is robust against typical attacking behaviors. © 2019 IEEE.",E-commerce; Return rate; Subjectivity,Computer aided instruction; Information systems; Information use; Analysis and simulation; Computational reputation models; E-marketplaces; Product returns; Reputation modeling; Reputation systems; Sales,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084927058

The following two scenarios have been examined: the retailers process inventory products on their own; and the suppliers remanufacture the downstream retailers inventory products. The decision of remanufacturing or recycling selection of the upstream suppliers is studied. The paper proposes a supply chain model based on the influence of recovery effort and consumers' price sensitivity to the remanufactured or recycled products. We use the reverse induction method in the game theory to find out the Nash equilibrium solution of the supply chain under different circumstances and then discussed whether the supplier chooses the constraint condition of remanufacturing. We simulated and analyzed the cost coefficient of recovery effort, the influence of price sensitivity coefficient, the recovery effort efficiency coefficient, the repurchase price on the decision-making behavior and expected profits of supplier and retailer.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a multiple-case study design, this research applies abductive reasoning to examine data from in-depth, semi-structured interviews and direct researcher observations collected during site visits at case companies. Findings: Costly or high-risk returns may require agents to specialize the depth of their mental schema. Processing agents need freedom to interact, self-organize and learn from other agents to generate emergent ideas and adapt. Practical implications: Limiting the depth of individual agent schema allows managers to better allocate labor to processing product returns during peak volume. To boost adaptability, managers need to craft a dynamic environment that encourages agents with diverse schema to interact, anticipate, and self-organize to brainstorm new ideas. Managers need to resist the urge to “control” the dynamic environment that ensues. Originality/value: This paper builds on existing research that studies the key decision points in the analysis of product returns by exploring how processing-agent behaviors can create adaptability in the reverse supply chain. Additionally, this research follows in the tradition of Choi et al. (2001) and Surana et al.

The analysis considers the extent to which return policy activities correspond to the needs and expectations of the target group, and addresses the role of this policy in the process of making the decision to return. The data used for the analysis are policy planning documents, The Emigrant Communities of Latvia survey and in-depth interviews. The main empirical evidence of the return experiences of migrants in the chapter comes from 18 in-depth interviews with Latvian returnees from various age and social status groups, who left Latvia within a period between 1991 and 2011. This research finds that although the government’s policy corresponds to the general needs of return migrants, this policy has no impact on individual return decisions among Latvian migrants. The main reasons for return are non-economic. If economic reasons dominate the reasons for leaving – alongside a wish to see the world or get an education – then coming back is connected with homesickness, a willingness to spend more time with relatives in Latvia, a longing for Latvian nature, a desire to speak Latvian and to live in the Latvian environment. It also eliminates the risk of assimilation for their children in the society of the country they have emigrated to. © The Author(s) 2019.",,,Book chapter,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85094163615

Despite the growing number of product returns, there is limited research that focuses on customers' perception of the return process in an omni-channel retail environment. To fill this gap, via an empirical analysis, this paper examines the influential factors on customers' return channel loyalty. Our structural equation modeling results found that perceived risk, purchase-return channel consistency, monetary cost, and hassle cost influence customers' return channel loyalty. Comparatively, perceived risk has the highest impact on customers' return channel loyalty. Additionally, hassle cost has more influence than monetary cost on customers' return channel loyalty. We also found that both internal (ambiguity tolerance, patience, and familiarity)and external (return policy flexibility)factors influence customers' perceived risk. Comparatively, channel familiarity has a higher influence on reducing customers' perceived risk compared with patience and the channel's return policy flexibility. Understanding customers' perceptions of a return channel is the first step in the implementation of an effective return management strategy in an omni-channel retail environment. This first step will provide retailers with opportunities to better understand the needs of targeted customers, offer improved post-sales services, and optimize their handling of product returns. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Customer loyalty; Omni-channel; Perceived risk; Product returns,Industrial economics; Industrial engineering; Ambiguity tolerances; Customer loyalty; Empirical analysis; Influential factors; Omni-channel; Perceived risk; Product returns; Structural equation modeling; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065401910

Consequently, publishers have revised their business models and integrated pay-per-article options. To reduce pre-purchase uncertainty, consumers can use information from firm-induced (e.g., newsletters), or consumer-induced communication (e.g., likes). These communication activities avoid purchases with poor fit but also increase customer expectations. Consequently, their effect on sales, returns, and profitability is unclear. For digital products, these effects are even less clear because product quality is difficult to evaluate pre-purchase, and products can be returned at almost no cost, even after consumption. In this study, we investigate the effects of firm- and consumer-induced communication on digital returns in the context of news articles on a major online platform (Blendle). We rely on a multi-equation model to quantify the effect of firm- and consumer-induced communication activities (i.e., newsletter promotions sent out by the platform and consumer likes from readers) on sales and returns and calculate their profitability impact. Our results show that newsletters decrease returns but do not significantly affect sales. In contrast, consumer likes have a twofold effect by increasing sales and decreasing returns. A simulation shows that both newsletters and likes increase profitability and that likes have a higher potential. Our results offer much needed guidance for online aggregators of digital products (e.g., audiobooks, e-books or news articles), as well as for online publishers based on pay-per-unit business models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Consumer likes; Digital business model; Digital product returns; News media; Paid content; Profitability,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060469351

Many firms are offering promised delivery lead time (PDL) as a marketing strategy to attract customers in a time-sensitive market. However, the previous study ignores PDL’s effect on the product returns: the occurrence of returns depends on the delays in the delivery of orders to consumers relative to the initial promises made by the enterprises. Therefore, in this paper, we assume not only the market demand but also the product returns are PDL-sensitive and investigate the impact of returns on an enterprise’s decisions and profit. In this paper, we assume the enterprise use the full-refund policy with an exogenous price. Two scenarios are investigated: one in which the enterprise only decide the optimal PDL and the other in which the enterprise should decide both PDL and the effort level. We analyze the general model where the realized lead time t is a random variable in scenario 1. Further, we consider a special case where t follows uniform distribution for more specific analyses in scenario 2. We conduct numerical examples to better illustrate the impact of the returns sensitivities on the optimal decision and the profit. Our findings suggest that: (1) Depending on the interrelationships of parameters, such as the return rate to sales (demand), the return sensitivity to delay and cost sensitivity, E-commerce enterprises will choose different strategies in both scenarios. In scenario 1, the enterprise will use shortest-PDL strategy when the returns sensitive to delay ( β ) is relatively low, and lengthen PDL as β is larger than a threshold value. In scenario 2, the enterprise would take the strategies of shortest PDL-lowest effort level, shortest PDL-medium effort level and increasing PDL and effort level respectively while β increases. (2) It is quite crucial for enterprises to take delay dependent product returns into consideration while making PDL and other related decisions. Though the enterprise could make exact optimal decisions even without considering the possible returns from PDL in the case β is relatively low, the shortest PDL is no longer optimal in other cases. Furthermore, the enterprise with a high returns rate itself would be more susceptible to increase PDL for the same β than other enterprises. In summary, this paper gives some managerial insights for e-commerce enterprises to make decisions while considering delay dependent product returns. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to incorporate the delay-dependent product returns into the mathematical model and illustrate the impact of returns on PDL and other decisions and profit © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.",E-commerce; Effort level; Product returns; Promised delivery lead time,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149036277

The quantity and timing of the returns of used products for remanufacturing depend on the quantity of new products sold in previous periods. Conventional time series forecasting techniques are not able to capture the relationship between past sales and future returns and hence cannot be used to predict used product returns for remanufacturing. Distributed lag models (DLMs) which can model the dependence of future returns on past sales has been proposed in previous studies for forecasting used product returns. However, the choice of an appropriate lag function for the DLM and estimation of the parameters of the lag function were the main challenges in previous studies. In this research, a DLM with a negative binomial lag function is proposed for forecasting used product returns, and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate of the parameters of the lag function. To validate the forecasting model, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) are computed. Numerical experiments were conducted to illustrate the proposed forecasting model and the parameter estimation approach. The results showed the proposed forecasting model predicts used product returns with good accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.",Bayesian Markov-chain Monte-Carlo; Forecasting; Product returns; Remanufacturing; Uncertainty,Intelligent systems; Lagrange multipliers; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Parameter estimation; Bayesian markov chain monte carlo; Distributed lag models; Numerical experiments; Product returns; Remanufactured products; Remanufacturing; Time series forecasting; Uncertainty; Forecasting,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061837069

However, the return strategy of the retailer is more affected by the return policy of another channel than the net salvage value. In order to reduce online returns, we propose the online product customization channel, and then, we examine the choice of return policy and the manufacturer's channel selection. We show that the demand and profit of the manufacturer will increase to a certain extent when opening an online customization channel.

Since price deters the adoption of an upgraded quality product, consumers evaluate both the quality improvements and the new release price before deciding whether to return a good. The returns can be either voluntary (passive returns) or dependent on the firm's controls (active returns), while the pricing strategies can be either fixed (constant intertemporal pricing) or varying over time (updated intertemporal pricing) depending on the quality improvements. By combining these two ingredients (return type and pricing policy) we formulate a two-period model in which a manufacturer invests in quality improvements and sets the product prices over time. Our results show that when consumers passively return old product versions, the manufacturer should always update its pricing strategies according to the quality improvements. However, when consumer returns are sensitive to quality improvements and price, the manufacturer can be indifferent between setting a constant or an updated pricing policy depending on the effect that quality has on returns. If the manufacturer can choose between a market in which consumer returns are passive or active, it decides according to how quality impacts the returns: When the consumers’ willingness to return according to the quality effect is negligible, the manufacturer prefers to work in a market with passive attitudes towards returns. While the choice of updating the price is always dominant from an economic point of view, it turns out to be suboptimal from an environmental perspective when the effects of quality and price on returns are balanced. When the price effect on returns also depends on the discount granted to consumers, then the discrepancy between economic and environmental returns is amplified. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Price; Product collection; Quality improvements; Return rate; Two-period model,article; consumer; human; market; total quality management,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053861314

We compare policies in which money-back refunds are given versus those where noncash refunds (e.g., gift cards) are used. We find that using noncash refunds can significantly reduce the cost of providing a return policy and may even make such a policy profitable. We also find that for retailers who already offer consumers periodic price discounts, offering a price adjustment policy with the same duration as the return policy can be optimal and can considerably reduce the cost of the return policy.

This is a noteworthy contribution as it highlights the complexity of the amalgam of relationships and factors that impact customer satisfaction within the context of reverse supply chain. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Complexity theory; Configural analysis; Customer satisfaction; QCA; Qualitative comparative analysis; Reverse supply chain; Supply chain research,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053232121

The large-scale expansion of electronic commerce with additional packaging certainly increases stress on the environment. However, a comparative analysis of environmental impacts of electronic commerce and conventional retail trade channels is unavailable. In this study, an Average Package Difference Model (APDM)was developed to evaluate CO2 emissions difference via the two retail channels in Shenzhen, China based on a life-cycle perspective. In the meanwhile, the national emission was estimated by the above results. Our results suggest that conventional retail has a higher environmental cost than that of electronic commerce, especially during shopping trips. Specifically, average CO2 emission difference per package in terms of product returns, packaging, buildings and transportation were 0.14 ± 0.03, 0.84 ± 0.08, 0.67 ± 0.04, 1.3 ± 0.26 kg, respectively. CO2 is mainly emitted from buildings and consumer trips in conventional retail trade, whereas packaging is mainly responsible for CO2 emission in e-commerce. In China, the total CO2 emission difference between conventional retail and electronic commerce was 124 million tons in 2016. Growth of the proportion of electronic commerce will contribute to lower CO2 emissions induced by the entire retail industry. Actually, carbon emissions can be reduced in both conventional retail and electronic commerce, such as the reusable packaging, opening shopping centers in dense population zones and promoting the usage of public transportation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Carbon emission; Conventional retail; Electronic commerce; Retail industry,China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Electronic commerce; Environmental impact; Packaging; Carbon emissions; Comparative analysis; Conventional retail; Environmental benefits; Environmental costs; Life cycle perspectives; Public transportation; Retail industry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electronic commerce; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; model; retailing; trade; Article; Average Package Difference Model; biodegradability; carbon footprint; China; cost control; dispersity; electronic commerce; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; industry; life cycle; mathematical model; packaging; population density; priority journal; socioeconomics; urbanization; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065524188

This study introduces a new two-echelon remanufacturing supply chain motivated by the practice. Different from the existing research, interactive production constraints (IPCs) are involved between a manufacturer's and a core remanufacturer's production. In this supply chain, the manufacturer produces new and remanufactured products, whereas the core remanufacturer recycles used products and makes remanufactured cores. A four-step Stackelberg game model is developed to investigate the two firms’ interactive decisions with IPCs. Analytical results show that, the core remanufacturer cannot fully satisfy the manufacturer's demand with adequate remanufactured cores when the transaction price is at a low level, conversely, the manufacturer can not accept all remanufactured cores that the core remanufacturer is supplying due to IPCs. IPCs significantly influence the firms’ decisions and the supply chain's performance. To improve the supply chain's performance, we propose a cross-advertisement policy that offers the firms with initiatives on interactive decisions when facing IPCs. We find that either the manufacturer's environmental advertisements on used-product returns or the core remanufacturer's environmental advertisements on remanufactured-product consumption can benefit the two firms in terms of profits and the supply chain in terms of environmental performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Game theory; Pricing and acquisition; Remanufacturing supply chain; Social responsibility; Sustainable supply chain management,Economics; Environmental management; Game theory; Pollution control; Supply chain management; Analytical results; Cleaner production; Environmental performance; Production constraints; Remanufactured products; Remanufacturing supply chains; Social responsibilities; Sustainable supply chains; Manufacture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060439938

This poses a new challenge to the sellers' dynamic pricing problem when some returns in good condition can be resold in the selling season. To study the impact of product returns and guide sellers in adjusting pricing policies, we build a product return model by augmenting the classic monopolist's dynamic pricing framework. We show that the return dynamics can complicate the problem by making it generally not Markovian. We address the technical challenges both analytically and numerically. Our analysis finds that ignoring returns leads to overpricing and can cause significant revenue loss when the demand is high, initial inventory is moderate, product return speed is high, and, intuitively, return probability is high. The analysis yields easy-to-implement heuristic policies that have good and robust performance relative to the theoretical benchmarks. We obtain many important findings for managers. For example, restocking product returns can be highly profitable even when the restocking cost is considerably high. Gaining visibility to customers' product return decisions, although helpful in forecasting returns and gauging total sellable inventory level, often provides small revenue benefits once the seller properly adjusts its dynamic pricing.

Digital media products are experience goods that often suffer from information asymmetry. Product return policies, as a popular and effective mechanism to reduce information asymmetry, have attracted extensive research efforts. Existing studies mainly focus on physical products that are often associated with high return costs; however, the effects of return policies on digital media products remains unexplored. To fill this research gap, this study empirically analyzes the impact of free returns on digital media products. Moreover, the moderating effect of online reviews on free returns is also investigated. Using data from a Chinese knowledge-sharing platform, two main findings are derived. First, a free return policy has a surprisingly negative impact on sales of digital media products. Second, the negative influence of free returns is weakened by the emergence of online reviews. This research contributes to the information system literature by exploring the effect of free returns on sales of digital media products in online marketplaces. From a managerial perspective, these findings will help platforms design an optimal return policy, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance long-term profitability. © 2019 Association for Information Systems.

We build a theoretical model of a dual-channel supply chain consisting of a risk-neutral supplier and a risk-averse retailer. Both channels provide consumer returns service. We thus examine the optimal pricing decisions for the supplier and the retailer and analyze the impacts of consumers’ sensitivity to returns policy on firms’ pricing strategies, product demands and the performance under retailer's different risk attitudes. We also consider the role of competition when consumers facing multiple suppliers or multiple retailers. It is shown that when consumers are too sensitive to the returns policy, providing consumer returns policy may hurt the online demand and the total demand. An increased risk aversion level of retailer may lead to a smaller expect utility for the retailer while a larger profit for the supplier. Surprisingly, the number of retailers does not affect the optimal decisions, only affects the competitive retailers’ expected utility. Furthermore, we find that a two-part tariff contract could coordinate the supply chain under the supplier encroachment when both members are risk-neutral. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Consumer returns policy; Risk aversion; Supplier encroachment,competitiveness; consumption behavior; retailing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057122938

Findings: US, Chinese and Western European online fashion retailers have more detailed return policies in the USA market compared to the China market. The results also indicate that US, Chinese and Western European online fashion retailers are more inclined to offer lenient return policies in the USA market which helps to lower consumer perceptions of uncertainty and negative prefactual thinking. Practical implications: Exploring online retailers’ return policies and how retailers respond to consumers’ level of comfort with uncertainty and tendencies to engage in negative prefactual within the context of different cultural markets offer valuable insight into standard retail practices necessary to retain profitability. Despite the perception of a “global” marketplace, nonstandardization of customer service is found.

This study seeks to understand and measure, if usage of mobile devices for online purchases leads to a lower decision quality and, in effect, to more product returns. In doing so, the impact of information environments on the end-to-end consumer purchase decision-making process is better understood and it is investigated, if the information environment of mobile devices leads consumers to take more error-prone purchase decisions. An exclusive data set spanning more than 140 million transactions of a European online retailer is used to empirically analyze changes in product return behavior after mobile channel adoption. The results show that mobile channel usage is positively related to product returns, overall and for both, purchases made with mobile devices and purchases made with desktop devices, although prior literature predicts that returns from desktop purchases should not increase.

We assume that the demand is a triangular fuzzy number (TFN), considering the SC coordination problem consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. The decentralized SC coordination model and the integrated SC coordination model under a fuzzy environment are established respectively. The fuzzy set theory is used to study the manufacturer’s quantity discount and the retailer’s coordination of return policy. The signed distance is used as the ranking method to find the optimal order quantity in SC, and the optimization theory is used to maximize the participants’ profits. We first demonstrate that the retailer’s profit will be reduced in a typical integrated channel, and then we propose a quantitative discount return policy to coordinate the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer. Finally, the coordination steps are designed, and the manufacturer’s return policy is given. Meanwhile, some illustrative cases are provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed model. © 2019 The Author(s).",Coordination mechanism; Fuzzy set theory; Imperfect quality; Quantity discounts; Return policy; Signed distance; Supply chain; Uncertain demand,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066446914

Therefore, three stimulating factors, including the carbon emission reduction, return policy and quality improvement efforts are taken into consideration in a supply chain (SC). In line with reducing carbon emission, two possibilities in the forward flow, including the technologies investment and the trade and cap are employed. In the reverse flow, hybrid remanufacturing of the imperfect quality products under technology license is investigated. The impacts of collecting-remanufacturing processes on carbon reduction, quality improvement, and SC performance are the key objective of this research. Therefore, two collecting-remanufacturing scenarios, namely A and B, are introduced to analyze the interactions between the abovementioned motivating factors. In Scenario A, the distributor collects the returns paying the refund price, while both the manufacturer and the distributor remanufacture the returns in the hybrid form under a technology license. In Scenario B, however, the third party is added to collect the returns, while the manufacturer and a third party remanufacture the products, where the distributor is only responsible to transfer and sell the products to the customers. The findings illustrate that under all remanufacturing rates investigated, the SC profit under Scenario B is more than that of Scenario A. Moreover, the interactions among the motivating factors are presented, in which a higher refund price has positive effects on the carbon reduction, quality improvement, and SC's profit. Furthermore, employing all of the stimulating factors simultaneously is an effective approach to increase SC performance environmentally and economically. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon emission reduction; Game theory; Quality improvement effort; Remanufacturing; Return policy; Technology license,Carbon; Emission control; Game theory; Manufacture; Motivation; Profitability; Sales; Supply chains; Carbon emission reductions; Closed-loop supply chain; Competitive supply chains; Effective approaches; Quality improvement; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing process; Return policy; Competition,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067277677

This chapter explores the reasons behind children's independent migration projects, the methods used to arrive in the E.U., and the legal framework protecting their rights. It does so with the aim of examining how the European Union treats unaccompanied and separated migrant minors, identifying gaps in policy, infrastructure, coordination, and data collection. In particular, the paper focuses on the reception, integration, and return policies of unaccompanied minors in Belgium, the United Kingdom (UK), and Romania.

Implementing buyer assistance programs and adjusting return time windows are two common methods that retailers use to actively influence return rates. A buyer assistance program can improve consumer understanding and reduce returns, but to be effective it must be focused on the products that are most likely to be returned. Managing return rates by adjusting return time windows, on the other hand, requires an understanding of the time dimension of returns, a topic for which there is scant guidance in the literature. Using a large dataset of consumer electronics purchases and returns for a major U.S. retailer, our study contributes to the research and practice of retail operations by: (i) providing new insights into the drivers of product returns and (ii) analyzing the time length of consumers' product trial, which can inform return time window decisions. We show that both product maturity (where a product stands in its life-cycle) and variety (the number of competing alternatives) are negatively associated with the probability of a return. By separating pure returns and exchanges, we further demonstrate that while more variety considerably reduces the former, it only marginally increases the latter. In addition, we find that consumers with more past returns not only have a higher probability of future returns but also tend to make late returns, with both factors increasing a retailer's cost to serve them. Finally, our analysis of the time to return shows that retailers may benefit from customizing their return time windows across different product categories, as well as enlarging the window during holidays. © 2018 Decision Sciences Institute",Consumer Returns; Econometric Analysis; Retail Operations,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055523866

Despite the growing literature on the promotions that are differently framed but offer economically identical values, little research has examined the link between promotion framing and consumer product returns. The current article sheds light on this relationship, hypothesizing that a free gift promotion would be superior to a bundle promotion in reducing consumer product returns. The findings suggest that a gift-framed promotion leads to a lower product return intention than an economically equivalent bundle promotion, because consumers tend to perceive more loss from giving up the gift-framed (vs. bundle-framed) deal. Further, this study examines a moderating role of brand familiarity (familiar vs. unfamiliar) and shows that the merits of free gift framing on product return intention via perceived loss are amplified (attenuated) when the promoted brand is familiar (unfamiliar). Overall, the investigations of this study imply that it is better to frame a promotion as a “free gift” than a “bundle” to increase perceived loss in returning the purchase and thus to decrease consumer product returns. This strategic intervention works especially when the gift is offered by familiar brands. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",brand familiarity; bundle; free gift; perceived loss; product returns; promotion framing,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053882156

Effective reverse logistics management facilitates the accomplishment of many goals for companies, such as reducing operational costs, increasing customer satisfaction, boosting brand value, and meeting the requirements of environmental regulations. However, the prominence of these motivations may vary according to sector. In some sectors, the strict government regulations in force may compel companies to implement reverse logistics, while in others, consumers may be highly conscious of the environmental-friendly production, encouraging companies to engage into reverse logistics activities. This situation calls for studies that analyse the differences in companies’ motivations to implement reverse logistics, and explain in turn how these differences shape their reverse logistics networks. Hence, this study has adopted a multiple-case study analysing reverse logistics activities of four companies each representing one of the following sectors: textile, battery, building materials, and food. Such cross-sectoral analysis enables an examination of the reverse logistics network design according to different motivation factors. The results reveal that different RL motivations have an impact on three reverse logistics design issues: the collection of returns, the location to inspect returns, and forward/backward integration on RL networks.

These studies, however, have not recognized that retail policies (regarding returns and exchanges) in the USA are much more liberal and “consumer friendly” than in other parts of the world, and thus it is possible that their conclusions are flawed. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the extent to which cross-national differences in complaint behavior are due to cultural vs situational factors. Design/methodology/approach: To examine this issue, a two-part study was conducted. Study 1 compared consumers living in China, India and Mexico to cohorts who immigrated to the USA. Study 2 compared individuals from those same countries to subjects who are native to the USA. Findings: The findings indicate that situational factors (i.e. consumer-oriented vs restrictive refund/return/exchange policies) have a large impact on consumer complaint behavior (i.e. redress, negative-word-of-mouth and exit), and that the effects of culture are minor. Research limitations/implications: To infer cause-effect, and establish scientific theory, one must rule out alternative hypotheses. Researchers who are investigating cross-cultural complaint behavior must take situational factors into account. Practical implications: With the emergence of “global consumers” consumer expectations around the world are changing. Astute retailers should institute and promote more liberal return policies, thereby mitigating consumers’ perceived risk. Originality/value: This study dispels the notion that culture is responsible for differences in cross-national consumer complaint behavior. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Complaints; Culture; EXIT; NWOM; Retailers,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057580687

Moreover, customer relationships are significantly influenced by after product-purchase service quality. Reverse Logistics is one such area, where there is ample room for improvisation. It deals with the process of product return from the customer to the manufacturer. The product maybe returned due to reasons like failure, product lifetime etc. It is different from traditional logistics where processes are carried out from manufacturer to final user stage only. It can be optimized and made predictive in nature to forecast the reverse flow of commodities. Conventionally, the commodities are sent back to the manufacturer upon encounter of failure. The products, under warranty period, are immediately replaced by the manufacturer. However, the quality of the service provided is deteriorating. With the advent of information age, it is possible to be prepared for tomorrow, today. By predicting the time of failure of a commodity, the manufacturer can retain service quality levels and help avoid customer churn. In Supply Chain Management(SCM), there is a plethora of data from different sources and in different formats. Big Data, Machine to Machine(M2M), IOT etc. provide a lot of scope into drawing clairvoyant insights. The aim of this paper is to discuss the methodology to forecast failure of a commodity. Such a model can not only help take prescriptive measures but also improve the service quality and protect a company's loyal customers. The paper also covers the process in all respects like the data extraction, management and cognitive approaches. © 2017 IEEE.",,Big data; Electronics packaging; Forecasting; Logistics; Predictive analytics; Public relations; Quality of service; Sales; Cognitive approaches; Competitive markets; Customer relationships; Machine to machine (M2M); Quality engineering; Reverse logistics; Reverse supply chain management; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain management,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050663627

Although there is a well-established research stream on the causes and mitigating factors for the bullwhip effect in forward supply chains, few studies have investigated how this phenomenon manifests itself in closed-loop supply chains. We argue that this phenomenon can affect the supply chain's environmental performance by increasing emissions, waste and consumption of natural resources. Aiming at filling this theoretical gap, this article compares the causes and mitigating factors of the bullwhip effect in forward supply chains and closed-loop supply chains. To this end, we employ a systematic literature review that combines bibliometric and content analyses. The studies examined in our review indicate that the causes of the bullwhip effect in closed-loop supply chains are similar to those in forward supply chains. However, most of the studies have not considered that the quality of returned products are different from the quality of their new counterparts’ products, adding another variable into the complexity of a given supply chain which, in turn, could lead to higher variability, thereby causing the bullwhip effect. Regarding mitigation, we found that the primary mitigating factor is related to increasing the product return rate. Moreover, we suggest that closing a supply chain can reduce the bullwhip effect, which could lead to positive impacts in the environmental performance of supply chains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Bullwhip effect; Circular economy; Closed-loop supply chain; Green supply chain; Reverse supply chain; Sustainability,Emission control; Environmental management; Supply chain management; Bullwhip effects; Circular economy; Closed-loop supply chain; Green supply chain; Reverse supply chains; Sustainable development,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053109352

At the same time, credence goods such as sustainable products become increasingly important in retailing. This study aims to combine these two developments and empirically investigates the effect of credence goods on product returns and sales after returns in e-commerce. Furthermore, we assess how third-party assurances can help organizations to positively affect customer behavior and reduce product returns of credence goods. Our research is based on unique data from a large-scale online field experiment with 35,000 customers combined with data of more than one million past transactions of these customers. Surprisingly, the results reveal that credence goods are associated with lower product returns than experience goods. Adding a third-party certificate to the online product description helps to reduce product returns and increase sales after returns. We find that customer relationship strength and price consciousness act as boundary conditions for the certificate to reduce product returns. Our research contributes to signaling theory and extends IS literature on product uncertainty and returns to the field of credence goods. Furthermore, we provide relevant insights for e-commerce practitioners on how to manage sales and returns of credence goods. © 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

The objective of this review is threefold: first, to identify elements of order-fulfilment operations that are relevant to online consumer behaviour (purchase, repurchase, product return); second, to understand the relationship between order-fulfilment performance and consumer behaviour; and third, to inspire future research on developing consumer service strategies that takes account of these behavioural responses to order-fulfilment performance outcomes. The paper is based on a systematic review of literature on online consumer behaviour and order-fulfilment operations, mainly in the fields of marketing and operations, published in international peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and September 2015. This study indicates that the current literature on online consumer behaviour focuses mainly on the use of marketing tools to improve consumer service levels. Very little research has been conducted on the use of consumer service instruments to steer consumer behaviour or, consequently, to manage related order-fulfilment activities better. The study culminates in a framework that encompasses elements of order-fulfilment operations and their relationship to online consumer behaviour.

In this extension, we consider a stepwise discontinuous procurement cost structure due to the fixed cost per batch replenished, incurred by the retailer, in addition to the classical lot sizing costs.

However, this flexibility on the part of the customer causes the respective e-commerce companies to incur heavy losses because of the delivery logistics involved and the eventual lower resale value of the product returned. In this paper, we consider data from one of the leading Indian e-commerce companies and investigate the problem of product returns across different lifestyle verticals. One of the striking observations from our measurements is that most of the returns take place for apparels/garments and the major reason for the return as cited by the customers is the 'size/fit' issue. Here we develop, based on past purchase/return data, a model that given a user, a brand and a size of the product can predict whether the user is going to eventually return the product. The methodological novelty of our model is that it combines concepts from network science and machine learning to make the predictions.

Second, the prepayment proportion and the consumers' hassle cost of return have a negative cross effect on the retailer's profit, which indicates that when the consumers are allowed to preorder the product with a relatively low proportion of prepayment, the retailer should impose more restrictions to increase the consumers' hassle cost of return. Third, the prepayment proportion and the ex-ante product information perceived by consumers also have a negative cross effect on the retailer's profit, which indicates that the retailer should consider the degree of product information disclosure when adopting the part prepayment scheme.

To make best use of imperfect information and integrate it with inventory supply decisions, we allow for returning excess stock built up due to imperfections to the upstream supplier and we propose a lost-sales inventory model with a general representation of imperfect ADI. A partial characterization of the optimal ordering and return policy is provided. Through an extensive numerical study, we investigate the value of ADI and factors that affect that value. We show that using imperfect ADI can yield substantial savings, the amount of savings being sensitive to the quality of information; the benefit of the ADI increases considerably if the excess stock can be returned.

Our analysis derives the optimal policies and shows that they take the form of contingence model in which the policies depend on consumer initial return and NE return. We also examine the influence of the consumer return NE effect on buy-back contracts of the supply chain and show that while the traditional buy-back contract fails to coordinate the supply chain, the NE effect does not render the differentiated buy-back contract less effective.

The model allows for a three-level distribution system which include customer, distributor and plant, where customers can also supply items to other requesting customers.

Minorities’ Diminished Return theory, however, suggests that the protective effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on health are weaker for racial minorities than White families. It is unknown whether the association between SES and CA differs for White and Black families. Aims: Using a national sample, the current study compared Black and White families for the association between living above the poverty line and CA. Methods: Data came from the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), 2003–2004, a national telephone survey. A total of 86,537 Black or White families with children (17 years old or younger) were included in the study. This sample was composed of 76,403 White (88.29%) and 10,134 Black (11.71%) families. Family SES (living above the poverty line) was the independent variable. The outcome was CA, reported by the parent. Age, gender, and childhood obesity were the covariates. Race was conceptualized as the moderator. A number of multivariable logistic regressions were used in the pooled sample and specific to each race for data analysis. Results: In the pooled sample, living above the poverty line was associated with lower odds of CA. An interaction was found between race and living above the poverty line on odds of CA, indicating a smaller association for Black compared to White families. Although race-stratified logistic regressions showed negative associations between living above the poverty line and CA in both White and Black families, the magnitude of this negative association was larger for White than Black families. Conclusions: The health gain from living above the poverty line may be smaller for Black than White families. Due to the existing Minorities’ Diminished Return, policies that merely reduce the racial gap in SES may not be sufficient in eliminating racial health disparities in the United States. Public policies must go beyond reducing poverty to address structural and environmental risk factors that disproportionately impact Blacks’ health. Policies should help Black families gain health as they gain upward social mobility. As they are more likely to face societal and structural barriers, multi-level interventions are needed for the health promotion of Blacks. © 2018 by the authors.

While the literature has provided insights into the design of the partial-refund policy, little attention has been directed at the design of the quota-based return policy. Accordingly, this paper explores the relative preference of a quota-based policy vis-à-vis a partial-refund policy. We do this, first, in the context of risk-neutral channel partners to identify the strategic decisions of each party and the effect of demand uncertainty on the variation of their respective profits. Our results reveal that the manufacturer faces higher profit variation (between the different demand realizations) under the quota policy. The variance in profits for the reseller is, however, higher under the partial-refund policy. We explain the source of profit variations by comparing it across different channel structures (centralized and decentralized). Next, we formally extend the model to include a disutility associated with profit variation and show that when the manufacturer has a variation-induced disutility, the partial-refund contract should be used, as it is the dominating contract. Similarly, when the retailer has a variation-induced disutility, the quota contract should be used. This is consistent with the pattern of profit variations in the risk-neutral case where the manufacturer has lower variation with the partial-refund contract while the reseller has lower variation with the quota contract. Finally, our analysis also shows how the manufacturer may employ a combination policy to better manage its own profit variation while providing adequate overstocking protection for the reseller. © 2018 INFORMS.",Channel management; Inventory stocking and pricing decisions; Return policy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056332708

First, we find that RFI generally increases the price level on the platform. Second, we find that when retailers have same base return rates, retailers' profits are not changed while the platform's profit is increased. Whereas, when retailers have different base return rates, RFI only benefits the retailer with high base return rate and harms the retailer with low base return rate, and RFI benefits the platform if and only if the product differentiation degree is relatively large. Third, we find RFI increases customer surplus if RFI's return hassle cost reduction (HCR) and/or willingness-to-pay enhancement (WTPE) effect is relatively strong. Moreover, we find RFI increases social welfare if RFI's HCR and/or WTPE effect is relatively strong and the product differentiation degree is relatively large.

The study identifies five important SSCPs, such as sustainable design and development, strategic sourcing and efficient technology and sustainable product returns and recycling. Among the selected industries, pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical industries were identified to be the front-runners in SSCPs practice. Subsequently, these five processes and three industries were evaluated using strategic decision making approach by integrating group decision making and fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methods. To handle the uncertainties of strategic decision making, six Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods have been applied and compared to understand their relevance while evaluating the above industries, based on the above identified SSCPs.

Different recovery options such as product remanufacturing, component repairing and material recycling are simultaneously considered. Initially, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model – with a profit maximization objective – for the network design problem. The structure of the product, by way of bill of materials (BOM), is also incorporated into the proposed model in order to analyze the flow at component and material levels. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to study the effects of variations in the values of the input parameters such as product return quantity, unit transportation cost per unit distance, and unit processing cost. The analysis shows that the design decisions of different facilities considerably change even for 5–20%% variations in input parameter values. This led to the development of a refined mathematical model which incorporates variations in the different input parameter values over time. The new model provides a unified design for the entire planning horizon and has been validated with the design of a used refrigerator recovery network. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Network design; Recycling; Refrigerator; Remanufacturing; Repairing; Reverse logistics,Computer system recovery; Cost benefit analysis; Integer programming; Logistics; Recovery; Recycling; Refrigerators; Repair; Sensitivity analysis; Transportation; Waste management; Mixed integer linear programming model; Network design; Product-return quantities; Remanufacturing; Repairing; Reverse logistics; Reverse logistics network; Reverse logistics network design; Product design,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038214700

Optimal buyback price, wholesale price, and retailer’s order quantity are determined for the supply chain under coordination. A computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of the members’ risk attitudes, refund amount, and retail price on the optimal decisions. Further analysis shows break-even points among utility values at different retail prices as the risk attitude parameters and refund amount change. These break-even points provide a guideline for the retailers to adjust the price to maximise the utility of profit.

Each supply chain consists of a retailer and an exclusive supplier with stable partnership. The two chains compete with each other in three competition structures: the Centralized Competition Game, the Hybrid Competition Game (including two cases), and the Decentralized Competition Game. In different competition structures, we examine how the degree of competition intensity between the two chains and product return rate of the reverse chain influence the equilibrium decision of market price, profits of two chains and the choice of centralization. The article differs from the study of the traditional supply chain model as follows. Firstly, we analyze the normal and the reverse chain related to the same product in the Betrand competition. Secondly, the data show that the market price decreases with the rising of the product return rate and the falling of the competition intensity. Thirdly, it is found that the total profit of the normal chain decreases with the rising of the product return rate, while the total profit of the reverse chain increases with rising of the product return rate. Profits of two chains increase with the rise of the competition intensity.

In particular, E-tail has provided customers with great convenience by allowing them to purchase retail products anywhere without visiting the actual stores. A recent trend in E-tail is to allow free shipping and hassle-free returns to further attract online customers. However, a downside of such a customer-friendly policy is the rapidly increasing return rate as well as the associated costs of handling returned online orders. Therefore, it has become imperative to take proactive measures for reducing the return rate and the associated cost. Despite the large amount of data available from historical purchase and return records, up until now, the problem of E-tail product return prediction has not attracted much attention from the data mining community. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a generic framework for E-tail product return prediction named HyperGo. It aims to predict the customer's intention to return after s/he has put together the shopping basket. For the baskets with a high return intention, the E-tailers can then take appropriate measures to incentivize the customer not to issue a return and/or prepare for reverse logistics. The proposed HyperGo is based on a novel hypergraph representation of historical purchase and return records, effectively leveraging the rich information of basket composition. For a given basket, we propose a local graph cut algorithm using truncated random walk on the hypergraph to identify similar historical baskets. Based on these baskets, HyperGo is able to estimate the return intention on two levels: basket-level vs. product-level, which provides the E-tailers with detailed information regarding the reason for a potential return (e.g., duplicate products with different colors). One major benefit of the proposed local algorithm lies in its time complexity, which is linearly dependent on the size of the output cluster and polylogarithmically dependent on the volume of the hypergraph. This makes HyperGo particularly suitable for processing large-scale data sets. The experimental results on multiple real-world E-tail data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HyperGo. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Clustering; E-commerce; Graph partitioning; Hypergraph; Product return,Data handling; Data mining; Electronic commerce; Forecasting; Graphic methods; Logistics; Retail stores; Clustering; Data mining community; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Graph Partitioning; Hypergraph; Hypergraph representations; Large scale data sets; Product returns; Sales,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051506867

With empirical data from 730 online consumers of fast-moving consumer goods in Sweden, the study finds that, after controlling for shoppers’ age, education, income, gender, and frequency of online purchases, perceived consumer trust fully mediates the effect of perceived return policy leniency on purchase intention.

We also show that the leadership strategy in a duopoly setting depends on the retailer's efficiency in selling the product (quality and acquisition cost) and handling customer returns (if an MBG is offered), relative to the competing retailer. We find that both retailers will choose sequential games and we identify when a retailer will be a pricing leader or follower in a competitive market. We identify the globally optimal leadership strategy for the duopoly when a retailer's efficiency in selling the product and handling customer returns is comparable to that of the competing retailer. In addition, we show that a retailer's MBG returns policy has a significant effect on the leadership strategy in duopoly competition.

For instance, a manufacturers’ retail arm provides consumers with the instant gratification of product purchase and the benefit of in-store shopping assistance, whereas their online arm offers potential benefits by selling to market segments that value shopping convenience, product variety, availability, and customization. The main difference between these two channels is that consumers cannot “touch and feel” the product before they make an online purchase, whereas they can physically inspect and often even experience the product before making an in-store purchase. As a consequence, the online arm implies a higher degree of uncertainty about product fit than the retail arm. The ensuing possibility that consumers will return the product, due to product misfit, might impact the manufacturer's design of the channels of distribution. We show that product marginal value and salvage value for product returns determine whether the manufacturer will sell his product through “bricks” only, “bricks and clicks,” or “clicks” only. Our work highlights the pivotal role that online and retail channels play in the manufacturers’ sales strategies in a market characterized by returns, wherein the online channel reduces double price marginalization and the retail channel curtails the number of returns. In particular, we show that a “bricks and clicks” channel structure may be the most profitable option for the manufacturer, due to its flexibility in reducing returns without adhering to strict return policies that would hurt sales. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society",consumer returns; game theory; return policies; sales channels,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041955983

Our findings across two experimental studies and an observational field study show that a well-considered package design, including colorful packaging and extra gifts, significantly lowers consumers’ return intentions and actual returns.

However, Finnish politicians increasingly abandoned the view of a common Lutheran identity between Ingrian Finns and Finland, and shifted the discussion to language, ancestry and historical memory, which were used to both endorse and disendorse Ingrian Finns’ Finnishness. We argue that the disappearance of religion from the Right to Return discourse was a strategic–if not necessarily conscious–choice that emphasized the more primordial aspects of Finnish identity (and the Ingrian Finns’ lack of those), which in turn enabled stricter restrictions and, ultimately, the discontinuation of the policy. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",citizenship; discourse; ethnicity; Finland; Ingrian Finns; national identity,Finland; Russian Federation; citizenship; ethnicity; migration; national identity; political discourse; religion,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017651210

Consumers often make purchase decisions without complete information on the product, and may not buy the product unless they can dispose of it to recover some of the cost after purchase. A retailer's provision of returns allowance functions as a form of insurance, encouraging consumers to purchase the product from the retailer; however, the size of consumer returns has soared and is eroding the manufacturer's and retailer's profits significantly. In this study, we consider consumers’ resale decisions, as well as returns decisions, concurrently in disposing of the product after purchase. The findings suggest that a retailer should offer resale service and give all the revenue from selling a used product to the consumer who demands the resale. By so doing, the retailer induces consumers to resell their product instead of engaging in more costly product returns. Therefore, the retailer-run resale market not only increases the price and sales of new products but also decreases the size of consumer returns.

Based on the notion that elevated power reduces regret anticipation—the fear of making a wrong choice—it is proposed that power influences the extent of choice deferral by reducing consumers' susceptibility to anticipated regret. Because of the regret-based mechanism, power can increase or decrease consumers' propensity to defer choice, depending upon the situational factors that are associated with anticipated regret, such as salience of regret, outcome reversibility (e.g., return policy), and locus-of-regret (postponing vs. choosing now). Using different manipulations of power, seven studies provide consistent support for the proposed effects and show that situational factors and marketing strategies can induce, turn off, or even reverse the effect of power on deferral.

The challenge before the managers is to decide the appropriate location to establish the remanufacturing facilities in the reverse supply chain. Several conflicting criteria need to be considered before establishing a remanufacturing facility. In this paper, a framework is proposed to evaluate an ideal location for opening a remanufacturing plant, with the aid of ideal solution based multi criteria decision making (MCDM) tools, specifically TOPSIS, GRA and VIKOR. The suitable candidate location is then selected using the veto rule, which helps to overcome the limitation of using a single MCDM tool. An illustrative application in the Indian automotive sector is demonstrated to show the applicability of proposed framework.

We hypothesize that, by reducing product uncertainty, product reviews affect the probability of product returns. We elaborate this hypothesis starting with an analytical model that examines how changes in valence and precision of information from product reviews influence the purchase and return probabilities of risk-averse, but rational, consumers. We then empirically test our hypotheses using a transaction-level data set from a multichannel, multibrand North American specialty retailer. Harnessing different consumers' purchases and returns of the same products, but with varying sets of product reviews over two years, we show that the availability of more reviews and the presence of more ""helpful"" reviews, as voted by consumers, lead to fewer product returns-after controlling for customer, product, and other context-related factors. Analyzing the purchase behavior of the consumers, we find that when fewer product reviews are available, consumers buy more substitutes in conjunction with a product, potentially to mitigate their uncertainty. Purchase of substitutes, in turn, leads to more product returns. Finally, leveraging a discontinuity in the displayed average ratings, we find that when products are shown with an average rating that is higher than the true rating, they are returned more often. These results support the predictions of our theoretical model-unbiased online reviews indeed help consumers make better purchase decisions, leading to lower product returns; biasing reviews upward results in more returns. The presence of online reviews has important cost implications for the firm beyond the cost of reprocessing the returns; we observe that when consumers return products, they are more likely to write online reviews and that these reviews are more negative than reviews that follow a nonreturned purchase. © 2018 INFORMS.",Product returns; Product reviews; Quality of purchase decision; Regression discontinuity,Aircraft manufacture; Consumer behavior; Purchasing; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Online product reviews; Product returns; Product reviews; Product uncertainties; Purchase decision; Regression discontinuity; Return probabilities; Theoretical modeling; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049954369

However, the implementation of closed-loop supply chain is confronted with numerous barriers and challenges due to uncertainties in input as well as in process. In contrast to manufacturing process where the input is mostly homogeneous raw material, the reverse chain's input comes from product's end-of-use or end-of-life; therefore the timing, quality and quantity are uncertain. The recovery process also brings other challenges due to various quality grades of the product returns and various recovery options. On the other hand, information technology has been studied extensively in relation to supply chain management. Most of the works show that the use of information technology could enhance supply chain performance. However, the study on the importance of information technology in closed-loop supply chain is still limited. In this paper, we discuss the role of information technology and then propose a conceptual framework of decision making in adopting IT in closed-loop supply chain management. We propose a conceptual framework for IT adoption decision making with four essential key attributes that are evaluated for each of the closed-loop supply chain activities. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.",Closed-loop supply chain; Decision-making; Framework; Information technology,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064977784

It determines the quantity of imminent returns and quality features such as age distribution and number of past cycles. Required data in real-time include the mean age of stock, a scaled quantity (population average) reliably monitored, even from small-size or decentralized stock samples, the maximum and minimum age in return samples and past volumes of net demand or sales. The characteristic parameters of the return distribution (center axis and spread) are updated in real-time. The method sequentially determines the retention probability in each time period, a key random variable that unties the dynamic closed-loop-supply chain knot. The retention probability sequence is used in explicit expressions for the product return flow and age distribution (a quality index), based on Markov representation of stock and flows. The model allows for arbitrarily random early loss and non-stationarities, uncertain demand and varying utilization of reusable returns. Markov-chain Monte-Carlo simulation enables assessment of the efficacy of the forecasting method. Exploiting reliable, current information, the method may provide improved estimates of product returns compared to linear models that relate returns to past levels of sales and/or returns, and utilize conventional regression, recursive least squares, or adaptive identification methods. Forecasting efficiency is higher as measured by mean or integral absolute error, and particularly so, regarding peaks and lows of the return flow. The results may be useful for enhanced acquisition of returns with reduced stock inventories and efficient planning of remanufacturing operations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Circular economy; Closed loop supply chain; Forecasting of product returns; Remanufacturing; Supply chain management,Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Least squares approximations; Linear matrix inequalities; Markov processes; Population statistics; Probability distributions; Supply chain management; Circular economy; Closed-loop supply chain; Forecasting efficiencies; Integral absolute errors; Markov chain monte carlo simulation; Product returns; Recursive least square (RLS); Remanufacturing; Monte Carlo methods,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048809412

We propose a new certainty-equivalent approach, which shows that offering product returns only changes the two firms' marginal costs without affecting their quality differentiation. Our proposed approach directly reveals that asymmetry of salvage values may overturn the recent finding that MBGs help the low-quality firm. Since MBGs only lead to marginal cost reductions, we show that each firm should adopt MBGs in equilibrium irrespective of the competitor's choice. We then examine the role of offering consumer returns in determining the firms' competitive product strategies. We demonstrate that offering MBGs does not directly affect the quality differentiation choices, and discuss the impacts of production technology and consumer valuation. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",competitive strategy; consumer returns; money-back guarantees; pricing strategy; product strategy; salvage value,Commerce; Economic and social effects; Competitive strategy; consumer returns; money-back guarantees; Pricing strategy; Product strategy; Cost reduction,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058342687

Retailers generally provide lenient return policies not only because they may signal high quality but also because they act as risk relievers for consumers’ purchasing decision processes. However, increasing product returns have become particularly challenging for the efficient management of inventory. As such, at the crux of a holistic inventory model lies the understanding of consumer return behavior. In this study, we introduce a variant of the classical single-period inventory (newsvendor) model with returns, in which heterogeneous consumers decide, based on their post-purchase valuation of the product, whether to return the product after using it. From the perspective of the retailer, such deliberate returns may abuse the return policy, which in turn may exacerbate reverse logistics and environmental costs. To that end, we incorporate demand uncertainty and consumer valuation uncertainty by explicitly gauging return probabilities and differentiated salvage values into a newsvendor model. We derive analytical results for the profit-maximizing order quantity for a single-period product that comes with a retailer return policy and exclusively identify the impact of return type as abused or normal. Also offered are closed-form optimal solutions in the cases where market demand is exponentially or uniformly distributed. Structural and numerical results lend managerial insight into how optimal ordering amount, profit, return rates and salvage values change with the price, return window, and hassle cost of returning the product. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Consumer behavior; Fraudulent proclivity; Inventory management; Product returns; Return policy; Uncertain demand,Costs; Inventory control; Logistics; Profitability; Sales; Fraudulent proclivity; Inventory management; Product returns; Return policy; Uncertain demand; Consumer behavior,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049348114

To address these problems, in this paper, we propose to use a weighted hybrid graph to represent the rich information in the product purchase and return history, in order to predict product returns. The proposed graph consists of both customer nodes and product nodes, undirected edges reflecting customer return history and customer/product similarity based on their attributes, as well as directed edges discriminating purchase-no-return and nopurchase actions. Based on this representation, we study a random-walk-based local algorithm for predicting product return propensity for each customer, whose computational complexity depends only on the size of the output cluster rather than the entire graph. Such a property makes the proposed local algorithm particularly suitable for processing the large-scale data sets to predict product returns. To test the performance of the proposed techniques, we evaluate the graph model and algorithm on multiple e-commerce data sets, showing improved performance over state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

To minimise the adverse impact of product returns on the firm's bottom line and enhance customer satisfaction with hassle-free handling of product returns processes, we develop and propose a mathematical model that determines the optimal collection period at an initial collection point (ICP) before transshipping the returned products to a centralised return centre (CRC) while taking into account the uncertain rate of returns for these products.

In this process, influential factors such as drivers and barriers have to be examined, and stakeholders’ different perspectives on RL implementation and development should also be considered. This paper presents a multi-perspective framework for reverse logistics implementation using the lens of stakeholder theory. The multiple stakeholders’ perspective framework was developed based upon a structured literature review process. Fifty-four papers concerning these topical areas were thoroughly assessed and classified according to their structural dimensions and analytical categories. Two extensive lists of 37 drivers and 36 barriers, categorized and analyzed against the dimensions and categories, served as a basis for the development of the referred framework. Thereby, the overall contribution of this work proposes an understanding of the factors required for employing reverse logistics from multiple perspectives, including those of the company, society, government, and customer. Additionally, each perspective is discussed separately with the aid of previous works developed in the field. Most of the encountered barriers are placed in the firm's perspective; however, these barriers may be an effect from outside impediments. On the drivers’ side, the factors must be acknowledged so managers can prepare for changes by exploring these positive influential factors. A consideration of the influential factors from multiple perspectives is critical for creating a comprehensive industry strategy to successfully implement product return. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Barriers; Drivers; Reverse logistics; Systematic literature review,Environmental regulations; Truck drivers; Barriers; Environmental operations; Industry strategies; Multi-perspective frameworks; Multiple stakeholders; Reverse logistics; Structural dimensions; Systematic literature review; Logistics,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044599139

Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI images combined with a cellular automata–Markov model were used to simulate and forecast LUCC, and expand analysis and reduce analysis methods were applied to explore the spatio-temporal patterns of LUCC in this basin. The results showed that in 2017–2067: (1) arable land, forestland and water would be expected to expand; (2) garden, grassland, building region, road, structure, artificial piling and digging land, and desert and bare surface would contract; (3) the rate of arable land expansion in 2032–2037 and the rate of grassland loss in 2057–2062 would be the largest changes, reaching 1.670 and 0.856 km2/year, respectively and (4) the expansion and contraction of different LUCC classes were closely related to the “Four Retire Three Return” policy implemented by the local government.

At the retailer, the demand in the first period depends on the selling price, product quality and refund price, whereas in the second period, it depends on the selling price and the product quality. The retailer sets the selling prices with variable markups on the wholesale prices of the manufacturer and offers a return policy (immediate return and used product return) limited to the first period only. The immediate return is dependent on the refund price and the product quality, and the amount of returned used items is a fraction of the first period's demand. The retailer sends the returned items to the manufacturer who reproduces/repairs those items and sells in the second period. We assume that the manufacturer acts as the Stackelberg leader and the retailer as the follower. We study the impacts of return policy, product quality and pricing strategy on the optimal decisions under two decision strategies (I and II). In the decision strategy I, both the players optimize their total profits over the entire selling season, whereas in the decision strategy II, they optimize each period's profit sequentially. With the help of a numerical example we explore that the decision strategy I gives better result than the decision strategy II in terms of all decision variables except the product quality. We also investigate the effects of key model-parameters on the optimal decisions. © 2019 EDP Sciences.",Closed-loop supply chain; Pricing strategy; Product quality; Remanufacturing; Retailer variable markup; Return policy; Two-period model,Costs; Profitability; Quality control; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Pricing strategy; Remanufacturing; Retailer variable markup; Return policy; Sales,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065670667

Although customers demand lenient policies such as free and late returns, tight control of returned items is mandated by the high costs of re-transportation and product value erosion. We model closed-loop fashion supply chains in order to describe, analyze, and optimize the performance of both forward and backward networks, including a secondary market. The model is based on a queueing system that combines the effect of new products entering the network for the first time with returned products entering the network for the second or nth time. We derive a closed-form expression for optimal service rates at both the test and refurbishment facilities and for the optimal return window. We then analyze the economic effects—on supply chain profit—of return rate, multiple looping of the same item in the supply chain, returned items being sold in a secondary market, and controlled delays in the refurbishment cycle. We apply our model to data obtained from a German fashion online retailer and report the managerial insights derived from this approach. Our results indicate how a company can set its return window strategically so as to maximize her profit as well as how it can decide whether to refurbish merchandise or sell it in the secondary market. In addition, we describe how refurbishment activities can sometimes lead to greater benefits even though the secondary market is usually an attractive opportunity for product returns. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Closed-loop supply chains; Customer sojourn time; Online fashion retailers; Product aging; Refurbishment; Return window; Returns management; Secondary markets,aging; market; model; profit,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027241805

The aim of this paper is to investigate the pricing strategies as well as the quality level and effort decisions of the manufacturer, retailer, and third party operating in two types of closed-loop supply chains: (1) single-channel forward supply chain with a dual-recycling channel (SD model) and (2) dual-channel forward supply chain with a dual-recycling channel (DD model). On the basis of these different channel structures, two manufacturer Stackelberg game models are developed to explore the best values for prices, quality levels, and sales and collection efforts. In addition, to draw managerial insights, corresponding equilibrium solutions of the two model structures are determined and compared, and the channel structure that most benefits each supply chain member is examined. To reduce channel conflicts and increase each channel member’ profits, a novel coordination mechanism is introduced and discussed. Two numerical examples are presented to simulate the strategies for choosing the best channel format for a decentralized closed-loop supply chain and examine the effectiveness of the coordination contract. The results revealed that the DD model is the best for the manufacturer, and the optimal channel structure for the retailer depends on the retailer's market share. However, by applying a novel coordination mechanism, all three members of a closed-loop supply chain can benefit from the introduction of an online selling channel. Furthermore, the results showed that the quality of products in the DD model is always greater than it is for products in the SD model. Moreover, it is observed from the sensitivity analysis that the recycling channel member with a predominant market share exerts greater collections effort and offers lower buyback prices than others in the collection channel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Closed-loop supply chain; Dual recycling channel; Dual-channel supply chain; Return policy; Sales and collection effort,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Environmental regulations; Game theory; Linear matrix inequalities; Model structures; Quality control; Recycling; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Structural optimization; Closed-loop supply chain; Collection effort; Dual channel supply chain; Recycling channels; Return policy; Supply chains,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048207691

(2) Second, scholars have investigated the implementation dynamics of such a cooperation. There has been a considerable interest in understanding the reasons for a ‘gap’ between the number of expulsion orders and effectuated returns.

This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by e-retailers which often lead to poor vehicle utilisation in the last-mile operation, as well as the duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62% of the total vehicle round time and 40% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",E-commerce; Last-mile delivery; Light goods vehicles; Parcels; Urban freight,England; London [England]; United Kingdom; Electronic commerce; Failure analysis; Sales; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Customer service levels; Delivery time windows; Goods vehicles; Last mile; Parcels; Public transport; Urban freight; Urban infrastructure; cycle transport; economic impact; electronic commerce; freight transport; infrastructural development; public transport; retailing; transport vehicle; urban transport; walking; Urban growth,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026298990

Several results are obtained. First, showrooming intensifies competition and lowers both firms’ profits, thus supporting traditional and online retailers’ recent strategy of carrying more exclusive varieties. Second, lowering consumer search costs may aggravate showrooming and decrease the traditional retailer’s profits for intermediate search costs. Third, opening an online store expands the demand of the traditional retailer but intensifies competition, thus lowering its profits under certain conditions. Fourth, a return policy by the online retailer alleviates showrooming and relaxes competition but weakly reduces its demand, increasing its profits only for intermediate search costs. The return policy (weakly) increases the traditional retailer’s profits. Fifth, when search cost is not high enough, price matching by the traditional retailer may also intensify competition and hurt its profits. We then examine how webrooming interacts with showrooming. When webrooming resolves partial match uncertainty, it may increase both firms’ profits by inducing more consumers to participate. © 2018 INFORMS.",Cross-channel competition; Inspection goods; Price competition; Showrooming; Webrooming,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049232221

For this structure, we construct the Stackelberg game model, provide the unique equilibrium, and bring up the conditions of offering full return policy for the opaque seller. Furthermore, we investigate how the market differentiates in the equilibrium results.

It is the first study of the radical political group Révolution Afrique. From 1972 until its ban by the French government in 1977, this organization forged by African and French activists mobilized against neocolonial ideologies and policies on both sides of the Mediterranean. By tracing the organization's rise and fall through extensive archival research and in-depth interviews, the article explores the changing meanings of transnational activism by weaving together the biographical paths of the activists, the institutional and political constraints they faced, and the ideological framework within which they operated. During this short time frame, the transnational agenda that made sense among African workers and students in the early 1970s became irrelevant. The increasing repression of political dissent in Africa and France, the suspension of migratory flows, and the French government's implementation of return policies in the late 1970s forced the group's African activists to adopt a more national approach to their actions, or simply withdraw from high-risk activism. Despite the dissolution of Révolution Afrique, this collective endeavor appears to have been a unique experience of political education for African activists, transcending distinct social and national boundaries that until now have been left unexamined by social scientists specialized in the complex history of the relationships between France and Africa. © Society for the Comparative Study of Society and History 2018Â.",France; Global 1968; Intellectual history; Migration; Political generations; Political transnationalism; Révolution afrique; Social movements; Swest Africa,,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054783862

To address this gap in the literature, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how product return behavior may differ by category of goods across these issues. The research is based on a survey of 283 Target and Wal-Mart retail shoppers. The findings may help retailers manage and target product return policies to reduce financial losses and build stronger customer relationships (Berger et al. 2007; Ketzenberg and Zuidwijk 2009; Stamer and Diller 2006). There are several goods categories reported in the literature; however, the present research utilizes a commonly accepted categorization developed by Enis and Roering (1980) that classifies consumer goods as convenience, preference, shopping, or specialty. ANOVA was used to test for significant differences in these constructs across the different category of goods. The hypothesis for differences by product category for product dissonance (H1) was not supported (F = 0.69, p = 0.557). Emotional dissonance (H2) was supported as significant differences between category of goods were found (F = 6.28, p = 0.000). Found better product (H3) was supported (F = 5.77, p = 0.001). Found better price (H4) was not supported (F = 1.95, p = 0.122). Customer opportunism (H5) was not supported (F = 0.97, p = 0.409). Awareness of return policy (H6) was not supported (F = 0.07, p = 0.978). Timing of return (H7) was supported (F = 3.88, p = 0.010). Product dissonance (H1) was predicted to vary across the category of goods but was found to be nonsignificant. This finding was surprising as it ran contrary to the existing literature indicating that variations of product attributes between categories of goods would influence dissonance. Return reason – found better price (H4) was predicted to vary across the category of goods but was also found to be nonsignificant. This is an interesting finding as the level of price and its associated perceived risk varies by product category. The research reported in this paper represents an initial investigation into the area of return behavior related to good categories. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",,,Book chapter,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125165637

Understood as the amount of time that buyers have within which to return purchased items, return time leniency is often considered one of the leading indicators of a retailer's MRP friendliness. In the current study, we extend prior work on MRPs by introducing a signaling theory perspective to return time leniency. This allows us to develop a more nuanced interpretation of the underlying economics associated with extending the window of time during which returns are accepted.

Therefore, a sustainable decision-making process should be implemented, for minimizing the effects of credit risk. The current paper uses a dynamic panel regression model to present the determinants of NPLs for the largest five banks of the Romanian Banking System during 2007-2016. A Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) regression is used and defined under three different types of variables: bank specific indicators, macroeconomic indicators and qualitative variables. Other studies illustrated also the determinants of NPLs in various banking systems from all around the world, such as Japan, China or several CEE countries (especially the emergent ones). After an in-depth analysis of the literature and Romanian market, the following variables were found to be relevant and were introduced into a dynamic data panel model: unemployment rate, annual average growth rate of gross domestic product, return on equity (ROE), loan to deposit ratio (LTD). The existing literature presents ROE as having a negative impact on NPLs, unemployment rate being positive correlated with NPLs and a negative relationship between economic growth and such loans. Our contribution to the current literature is represented by the introduction of two additional qualitative variables (Board Risk Management Ratio (BRMR), as the proportion of risk managers within the Board of Directors of each bank in question and the Expert Aggregate Priority Vector (EAPV), as the aggregated perceived risk regarding the NPLs). The decision of introducing these variables relies on previous research made in this area, results being validated by experts from the Romanian Banking System, according to the BASEL III and NBR criteria. The results of the current paper are consistent with the existent literature, the correlations and impact of the variables being relevant for the subject matter. © 2018, Editura Economica.

In this paper we study such a strategy for a retailer in the presence of both informed and uninformed consumers. Under such a strategy, the retailer sells the product over two periods, where the informed consumers may make pre-orders with unknown valuations in the first period and pick up the pre-orders in store with realized valuations in the second period. We first derive the optimal price discount for the pre-orders and the optimal order quantity for the demands over the two periods. Then, we show that the BOPS strategy with pre-orders is not necessarily beneficial to the retailer in general. We identify the thresholds for the unit production cost and demand uncertainty, above which the BOPS strategy with pre-orders is beneficial. In addition, we derive the conditions under which the BOPS strategy with pre-orders and product returns is favourable to the retailer, even when the returned product cannot be re-sold. Moreover, studying the effects of the proportion of the informed consumers in the market, we show that under some conditions the BOPS strategy with pre-orders will generate more profit to the retailer when the proportion of the informed consumers increases. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Buy-online-and-pick-up-in-store; Pre-orders; Retailing; Returns policy,Pickups; Buy-online-and-pick-up-in-store; Demand uncertainty; Optimal order quantity; Order fulfillment; Pre-orders; Retailing; Returns policies; Unit production cost; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054465019

This article introduces the quality coefficient of waste products on the basis of the analysis of the structure of the remanufacturing cost. It explores the remanufacturing cost function, the recycling price function, and the recycling rate function. In the marketing process, new products compete with remanufactured products. Different consumers show different levels of degrees of acceptance of remanufactured products, contributing to the uncertainty of the willingness to pay for remanufactured products. The price of remanufactured products is always lower than that of new products, allowing price-sensitive consumers to turn to remanufactured products. This shows that product pricing has an impact on the market demand. Considering the difference between consumer willingness to pay and the quality of product returns, this article aims to construct a game model consisting of manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, with the manufacturers as leaders.

The consumers shop sequentially and their shopping strategy is similar to the search strategy of a consumer in a sequential costly search model. Thus, the pricing strategies of firms are identical to those in a price-directed sequential search model. Price competition is more intense, and the symmetric equilibrium price is lower when returns are costlier. As a result, consumer surplus is increasing in the return cost. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Duopoly; Horizontal differentiation; Return cost,Competition; Consumer surplus; Differentiated products; Duopoly; Horizontal differentiations; Price competition; Search strategies; Sequential search; Symmetric equilibrium; Costs,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027156814

Four prevailing return policies in which a manufacturer both operates an E-shop and sells its product through a brick-and-mortar retailer are analyzed, i.e. (I) the manufacturer handlings E-shop’s returns, while the retailer addresses brick-and-mortar store’s returns (NR); (II) the retailer tackles the whole (both E-shop’s and brick-and-mortar store’s) returns (ORR); (III) the manufacturer tackles the whole returns (ORM); and (IV) the manufacturer and the retailer are jointly responsible for the whole returns (RRM). Firstly, the optimal pricing and return policies comparing these four scenarios under uniform-pricing strategy are presented. Our conclusions show that the ORR is an optimal return policy. Compared with the NR, consumers will get a lower product pricing under the ORR and a higher product pricing under the ORM. With regard to the RRM, the product pricing is depended on consumer preference, return-rates of the E-shop and the brick-and-mortar store. Then, the optimal pricing and return policies are analyzed under differential-pricing strategy by conducting two-stage sequential games between the manufacturer and the retailer. The findings show that if consumers in the market prefer to purchase via the E-shop, the ORR is an optimal return policy. Otherwise, the NR is the optimal return policy. Compared with the NR, the ORR retailer’s product pricing will rely on the retailer’s and the manufacturer’s return-costs; the RRM retailer’s product pricing will depend on the return-costs of the retailer and the manufacturer, the return-rates of the E-shop and the brick-and-mortar store and so on. Finally, the influences of the manufacturer and the retailer establishing a Buy-back contract are discussed. Our results illustrated that the Buy-back contract doesn’t affect optimal pricing and return policies under both the uniform and the differential pricing strategies. © 2018, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Dual-channel; false failure returns; game theory; optimal pricing; optimal return policy,Brick; Game theory; Manufacture; Mortar; Sales; Supply chains; Buy back contracts; Consumer preferences; Differential pricing; Dual channel; Dual channel supply chain; False failure returns; Optimal pricing; Return policy; Costs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040743324

The assumed supply chain includes a number of manufacturers who provide their different, yet substitutable, products for their customers via a common retailer; however, manufacturers can have their own internet-based sales channels in order to provide products for the customers. The customers can return products if they are not satisfied with them. The returned products are collected in a repair center, repaired, and sold as second-hand products through the retailer's channel or through an internet-based sale channel. The customer demand is assumed to be stochastic. This study aims to determine the optimum prices for the internet-based and retailer's sales channels for the initial and second-hand products. It also tries to determine the optimal values of retailer order and production rates of manufacturers and repair centers. Three types of game strategies for the supply chain, including Nash, Stackelberg game with a retailer as the leader, and Stackelberg game with manufacturers and repair center as the leaders, are studied in a decentralized condition. The analytical equilibrium solutions, equations, and constraints are extracted for these strategies. Finally, the effect of variations in key parameter is investigated. © 2018 Sharif University of Technology.

To address firms' decision-making challenges, we consider a firm producing and selling its green products via an e-commerce platform. For optimal online return strategies, we find that if the residual value of the returned product is relatively small, the firm should not offer an online return service; otherwise, the firm should offer this service. Moreover, the results show that carbon tax policy is detrimental to the firm and consumers, while increasing the average customer satisfaction rate of the product benefits the firm and consumers.

A major impediment to unlocking the full potential of these returns is the firm’s returns management program: the policies governing the customerfirm exchange process. Recent insights from research and practice have yielded the unprecedented opportunity to open the “black box” of developing effective programs. Yet, such development must address three main questions: What types of returns management programs exist? What misunderstandings impede returns management effectiveness? How can retailers develop effective programs? This article distinguishes among different types of returns management programs and discusses the managerial misunderstandings that reduce their effectiveness. It presents a framework for developing, implementing, and controlling effective programs that allow retailers to boost sales, reduce returns, and increase profitability. © The Regents of the University of California 2017.",Behavioral operations management; Marketing strategy; Returns management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041042123

The lifetime of perishable product is equal to two selling periods. At the beginning of the first period, the manager decides an order quantity, and at the end of the period he has a chance to reorder or return some items. Therefore, we develop two kinds of inventory models, i.e., one is the inventory model with reorder policy and the other is the inventory model with return policy. We find that each inventory model is determined by an inventory threshold. A high inventory threshold is for the return policy, and a low inventory threshold is for the reorder policy. The reorder policy will be used only when the surplus inventory at the end of the first period is less than the low threshold, while the reorder policy will be used only when the surplus inventory at the end of the first period is higher than the high threshold. We also show that each inventory policy has its merit and demerit. © 2017 IEEE.",Lost sales; Outdate; Performance; Perishable; Shortage,Sales; Supply chain management; Lost sale; Outdate; Performance; Perishable; Shortage; Inventory control,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028624397

Therefore, inventory control is an important thing to do in order to optimally fulfilled product demand. Pharmaceutical unit is an installation support for the Hospital to provide drugs. Medicine is one of perishable products. Recently at department of pharmaceutical logistic in a Hospital, there are drugs that were not sold for 3 consecutive months a.k.a deathstock due to its slow-moving stock, so that the drugs stored too long in warehouse and lead to great inventory cost due to large storage cost. Drugs which will expire should be return to the supplier with an average lead time of five months, this raised the risk of stockout and high opportunity lost on the sale of these drugs. It is necessary to control supply by considering probabilistic demand, expiry and product return so it can minimize total cost of the inventory. The purpose of this research was to determine the optimal order quantity of drugs and minimizing the quantity of expired drugs to return.

One such strategy is to allow customers time to assess a product and return it if it is not in alignment with their expectations. As beneficial as such a strategy can be in terms of growing the customer base, it can have potentially adverse effects too, one of which is a growing returns inventory. Any sale made cannot potentially be considered as such until the time for returns is past. Given inventory is considered to comprise working capital (WC) by conventional accounting standards, returns inventory can be expected to impact cash conversion cycle (CCC), which is used as the basis for Working Capital Management (WCM). The same holds true for the theory of Total Productivity Management (TPMgmt), which places WC front and center based on its ability to influence productivity and profits. This paper explores the effects of returns inventory on both CCC and productivity with the aim to unearth synergies between TPMgmt and WCM.

The question is here: Does the implementation of WEEE directives make sense in terms of reducing the total cost of the network in the long term? This study aims to compare regulatory and non-regulatory situations of WEEE RLND in developing countries by formulating two models named as ‘regulatory’ and ‘non-regulatory’. Model 1 is considered as sustainable with economic, environmental and social goals, and the quotas imposed by the environmental directive are taken into consideration as the data of product return amount. In Model 2, only economic goal is considered, and product return amount is forecasted using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

When both products are available, customers will buy the one that gives them a higher (and non-negative) utility. Thus, if the firm does not price the products properly, then product cannibalization may arise and its revenue may be adversely impacted. In this paper, we study the pricing problem of a firm that sells both new and remanufactured products over a finite planning horizon. Customer demand processes for both new and remanufactured products are random and price-sensitive, and product returns (also called cores) are random and remanufactured upon receipt. We characterize the optimal pricing and manufacturing policies that maximize the expected total discounted profit. If new products are made-to-order (MTO), we show that when the inventory level of remanufactured product increases, the optimal price of remanufactured product decreases while the price difference between new and remanufactured products increases; however, the optimal selling price of new product may increase or decrease. If new products are made to stock (MTS), then the optimal manufacturing policy is of a base-stock policy with the base-stock level decreasing in the remanufactured product inventory level. To understand the potential benefit in implementing an MTO system, we study the difference between the value functions of the MTO and MTS systems, and develop lower and upper bounds for it. Finally, we study several extensions of the base model and show that most of our results extend to those more general settings. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society",new product; optimal policy; pricing; remanufactured product,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029209358

Drawing on risk theory, this article tests the influence of three important instruments on product return prevention. Three separate field experiments among customers of a well-known European online retailer reveal, unexpectedly, that the use of a money-back guarantee increases product returns, whereas product reviews decrease the product return rate.

The findings from previous studies are compared in order to identify more general patterns of energy consumption, describe which energy consumption factors (product waste and product returns, buildings, packaging, passenger transport and freight transport) are considered and what assumptions are made. In this comparison, we analyse product characteristics and product classes, discuss the energy factors with the greatest impact and the contextual impact of each factor on the energy consumption. The paper is based on a structured literature review and a content analysis, which helped us to synthesise current knowledge and explain consistent and inconsistent findings across individual studies of energy consumption in conventional sales channels versus e-commerce channels. Our literature search identified 11 studies, with 16 cases, that compared the energy efficiency. The results show the following: 1) The net effect of energy consumption was in the majority of the cases positive for the e-commerce channel, 2) The proportion of unsold products and product returns seem to have a major impact on the energy efficiency of different sales channels, 3) Buildings had only a minor effect on the energy consumption difference. It was slightly lower in the home delivery systems, 4) Packaging contributed considerably to the energy consumption difference for some products. The e-commerce channel consumed generally more energy from packaging, but indirect effects (e.g. volume efficiency) were not considered, and 5) The total energy consumption from transportation was greater in the conventional supply chains, as the additional energy in passenger transport generally outweighed the increased energy in freight transport in e-commerce.

This cost pressure is driven in part by extremely generous return policies, such as giving consumers a full refund upon return. Interestingly, this common retail practice of full refunds is inconsistent with the recommendations of many analytical models of returns, which nearly always show that a partial refund is optimal. Such inconsistencies between theory and practice might arise when the decision drivers included in the analytical models do not match the decision drivers in practice. It might also be the case that retailers are overly optimistic about the value that consumers assign to a full refund, and thus assume that the value of such a policy outweighs its costs. In this paper, we use data collected from eBay, where identical products are sold with different return policies, to investigate these open questions in the literature. We analyze both the return policy drivers from the retailer's perspective and the return policy value from the consumer's perspective. Our results suggest that the value of a full refund policy to consumers may not be as large as one might expect, and it also exhibits a large heterogeneity across buyers with different levels of online purchase experience. In addition, we provide empirical evidence for what has long been suspected by online retailers – that a non-refundable forward shipping charge quickly erodes any value that consumers assign to return policies. The generality of our results is limited by the fact that eBay differs from traditional retail contexts in many respects, including the fact that eBay buyers may not be representative of the general buyer population. However, our study of how eBay consumers value free returns provides new insights into an understudied area, and it can serve as a starting point for future studies of the value of return policies in other retail contexts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Consumer returns; eBay; Marketing-operations interface; Online retailing,Costs; Decision theory; Electronic commerce; Sales; Consumer return; Cost pressures; Ebay; Marketing-operations interfaces; Online consumers; Online retailing; Optimistics; Product returns; Return policy; Theory and practice; Analytical models,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026651741

Further, national responses to the same phenomenon vary widely from Member State to Member State, creating considerable indeterminacy.

In the event of successive droughts over the past six years, the water resources were affected both from the viewpoint of quantity and quality. Due to successive droughts in the province and the uncontrolled consumption of water table, water resources has got into a dangerous situation and must be economized in different domains. The issue of virtual water trade is great and has particular importance in sustainable development planning of the future of many countries located in arid and semi-arid areas to save and maintain parts of water needed of domestic production of goods. The consideration that the consumption of meat and dairy products has an extraordinary effect on the dearth of water globally has been widely published and proclaimed. The consumption of animal products in large quantities has an extra effect on fresh water resources. About one third out of the world's total agricultural water footprint is related to animal products while their water- footprint is extremely higher than that of farm products with an equal nutritional value. Poor food efficiency in the process of production of livestock products is largely responsible for the relatively high water footprint and virtual water content. Life cycle assessment may help save water, return water to cycle and reduce energy costs. According to the statistics provided by the statistical center of Iran in 2013, the number of active cattle farming complexes in the province is around 180. If the consumption of livestock per capita is considered 100-150 liters daily for drinking and services (different in summer and winter), around 2086 cubic meters will suffice only for drinking needs in this part. 2. Materials and Methods This study was conducted with two main objectives: To determine the amount of virtual water content of one Kg of beef (calf) and also to optimize water use in the life cycle of a livestock breeding. So, in this boundary, cycle input is a farm for producing animal feed and cycle output is the slaughter- house. The method used in this study was presented by Chapagain and Hoekstra (2003) that determines the virtual water content and also estimates the grey virtual water used by Hoekstra et al. (2011). Also, the amount of water needed to irrigate the product is obtained in order to calculate the amount of water needed for the production of any agricultural product (animal feed). This is affected by the amount of evaporation from the soil surface. Blue virtual water, including water resources (surface and subsoil), is along with the supply chain of a product. Blue water used in this research includes water used in irrigating crops, drinking and washing services. Green virtual water content refers to the use of green water resources. Water used in dry farming (products for animal feed) is located in this category. However Rain-fed crops are not included in this study. As a result, blue-green water is sent together. Gray virtual water content refers to the volume of pollution and is defined as the volume of freshwater used to absorb pollutants to reach normal levels and current standards required for water quality. To calculate the virtual water derived from animal products such as ""pure meat"", it is necessary to acquire virtual water in living animals and then distribution of water in the products. Every living animal (cattle) has three components of virtual water. Virtual water content of an animal at the end of his life is the total volume of its virtual water content. This amount includes the amount needed for food, service, and drink. As mentioned above, for calculating the virtual water content of livestock and livestock products, having a virtual water content of the plant (used in animal feed) is needed (Hoekstra & Hung, 2002). To calculate the amount of water needed to produce each product, the amount of water needed to irrigate the product should be considered. Furthermore, the evaporation and transpiration from the earth's surface, soil and plant should also be included. As a result, information such as crop water needs throughout the growth period, evaporation and transpiration rate, annual performance product and product returns are required. Virtual water of crops (cubic meters per ton) is obtained by dividing the total amount of water needed to produce the entire product. Penman-Muntit equation is usually used to calculate the reference plant évapotranspiration. In the original Penman-Muntit equation water requirement of the plant is determined in one step by plant resistance coefficient, reflection coefficients and air resistance. Due to the lack of FAO data, regarding the constants in this equation, it has been calibrated to estimate the reference plant évapotranspiration. In this method, water requirement is calculated by using the coefficients occur in two stages. In this study NETWAT software is also used. 3. Results The amount of feed consumed by cattle depends on many factors like weather conditions in the region, season, race, diets and also whether the cattle is raised for meat production or not. Animal feed and diet composition are different although the same nutritional value as follows. Weight gain in beef cattle by nutrition is related to race. The amount of feed for cattle is calculated according to data from the case study. In this cycle, the virtual water content will be studied including blue-green water used for farm irrigation and gray water from the fertilizers and pesticides used on the farm. In this respect, the required information includes: area under crops fodder, expertise, the crop water requirements (used for animal feed) and the content of plants virtual water. After the assignment of feed intake of animal by each cattle breeding, feed virtual water content is achieved and then by using formulas, we calculate the virtual water content of the drink as well as the service. Value of virtual water in cubic meters per ton of bone and boneless meat from the original product (living cattle) can be obtained. Information and data relating to the calculation of value fraction are taken from the Foka's slaughterhouse. The cow virtual water content when slaughtering is 11055 cubic meters per ton. Virtual water content of meat with bone is 19485 cubic meters per ton and the virtual water content of boneless meat is 22, 800 cubic meters per ton. 4. Conclusions It is clear that animal products need a lot of water. As a result, different methods of water management in animal product chains should be proposed, evaluated and implemented. What can be a good happening in Iran and also at the global level is to apply changes in diet and to consume meat products as economically as possible. This can play a big role in saving water content of the food at the national and international level. Minimum and maximum values of water recovery on farms (within Isfahan Province) have been measured to be 17.6% and 59.1%, respectively. Therefore increased efficiency in the agricultural sector is an effective step to reduce water consumption. Alternatively, it is also possible to reduce water consumption by changing agricultural products. Using organic matters and agricultural biotechnology can help to increase agricultural productivity and thus reduce the virtual water content. Storage and transport of water process will have their own virtual water content. Due to different water requirements of plant performance in different regions, the virtual water contents in different provinces are not the same.

The project afforded students the opportunity to work on an international product development team, exposing them to the design requirements and constraints of international customers and companies. The often damp and cool climate in many countries makes food prone to becoming soggy during delivery as the moisture escaping from the hot food quickly fills the food containers and delivery box mounted to the back of the motorcycle, saturating the food. Delivery times, often in excess of 45 minutes, can also cause the food to become cold, resulting in decreased customer satisfaction, product returns and lost business. The project was conducted over a three year period using nine mechanical engineering students. The project began in 2014 when a team of two students was tasked with developing a benchtop method of keeping food hot and preventing it from becoming soggy while being delivered. They determined that the use of ceramic heaters and small fans effectively kept the food warm and dry. In 2015, two teams of two students competed to develop a box design with integrated heaters and fans which could be powered using an alternator mounted to a delivery motorcycle. While effective fans and heating elements were found, it was decided that the mounting of an additional alternator was cumbersome and motorcycle dependent, rendering the concept poorly suited for field installations. In 2016 another team of two students integrated a hand-made lithium ion Battery pack and two 300W ceramic heaters and computer fans into a production delivery box. While the system maintained food quality for up to 50 minutes, the battery pack was unable to reliably provide the required power to the system. Finally, in the fall of 2016, a student improved this design by improving the heater and fan performance while adding urethane insulation into the box. Temperature was controlled using a commercially available thermistor, and all components were integrated into a retrofit kit which could be installed by a technician in the field. The power requirement was reduced by over 50% and the system operated for 110 minutes using two, commercially available 27 Ah lithium iron phosphate batteries. Students gained global perspective of the product development process as they experienced the effects of various cultures on the requirements of customers and the international design and marketing team.

The retailer faces the opportunity to invest in store assistance to help consumers choose products and thus reduce product returns. Special attention is given to the impact of product returns and retailer's store assistance investment on manufacturer's dual channel decision. We examine conditions under which the manufacturer uses dual channels and how various relevant factors affect its channel decision under two settings, depending on whether the retailer has its own online store or not. When the retailer does not have its online store, we find that (i) the addition of the direct channel raises the wholesale price; (ii) the direct channel addition hurts the retailer if the nonreplacement rate is low; (iii) the manufacturer has a lower incentive to add the direct channel when the retailer's service cost is lower or its returns reduction rate from service investment is higher; and (iv) the manufacturer should treat its own returns handling cost as a key factor in its channel structure decision. In addition, when the retailer operates an online store, we find that the manufacturer may have an incentive to add a direct channel such that both firms own direct channels. © 2016 Decision Sciences Institute",Direct Channel; Distribution Channel; Game Theory; Product Returns; Store Assistance,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987624580

In this study, a selection of papers focusing on design collaboration in the fashion industry is reviewed. Four important value creation approaches in design collaboration are discussed: organizational, process, information, and electronic coordination. Among these categories, electronic coordination is a bridge for connecting organizations, processes, and information. With an electronically coordinated information system, an organization is able to participate in the design process; the co-design process can be implemented by individuals or organizations in the electronic system, and design information can be shared through electronic systems such as computer-aided design between individuals or organizations. Further, the benefits of design collaboration in the fashion business are explored. It is concluded that design collaboration is beneficial, as it can shorten lead times, enhance product quality, reduce product returns, optimize resources, and enhance the customer experience. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",coordination; design collaboration; design management; design process; fashion business; innovation,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029461116

Supplier sells fresh products through e-tailer in an online market, and the e-tailer offers a full-refund return policy to loss-averse consumers and exerts a fresh-keeping effort to keep the product at the optimum freshness level. By developing an analytical model, we derive the optimal price, quantity, and fresh-keeping effort jointly and verify that it is unique in the centralized setting. Based on the comparison, we demonstrate that the e-tailer's profit is greater with fresh-keeping effort than without it; therefore, the e-tailer has an incentive to engage in fresh-keeping effort. We also show that the return rate is independent of the fresh-keeping effort and consumers' loss aversion. In the decentralized setting, we first characterize the optimal wholesale price by the numerical study and then find that although the buyback contract still works, the revenue-sharing contract fails to achieve channel coordination under our model formulation. Furthermore, we develop a revenue- and cost-sharing contract that can coordinate the supply chain by designing a new contractual mechanism. Our numerical studies offer the Pareto improvement regions under the buyback and revenue- and cost-sharing contracts in which the supplier and e-tailer can earn more expected profits compared with being under wholesale price contract. © 2018 Bojun Gu et al.",,Cost effectiveness; Profitability; Supply chains; Buy-back contracts; Channel coordination; Contractual mechanisms; Cost sharing contracts; Pareto improvements; Product supply chains; Revenue sharing contracts; Wholesale price contract; Costs,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050794642

Therefore, via an analytical model, we examine the impact of modularity and consumer sensitivity to sustainability on the pricing decisions of two competing firms. Consider an environmentally conscious (green) consumer who will buy one of two available, horizontally differentiated products: a modular product (M) manufactured by Firm M or a standard product (S) manufactured by Firm S. Firm M can take advantage of its modular production technology and product return policy. For such a consumer-driven demand setting, we develop a model and solve to optimality a single-stage, non-cooperative game where both firms simultaneously set their competitive prices. In addition to analytical expressions for the optimal prices and the profits for both firms, we provide structural results and numerical examples to render practical insights: The refund rate has a strong impact on profits; sensitivity of product greenness can be increased by conscientious advertising, and the reusability of modular parts encourages lower pricing and higher market share. We assert that modularity is a strong concept and practice in developing sustainable products and thereby in production, which, in turn, may enhance sustainable consumption.

We propose a conceptual framework that extends the existing CLSC setting by introducing consumers’ disposition behavior. We develop eleven research propositions based on which we design a survey.

When the innovative firm commits to demonstration policies and there is flexibility in prices, the firm is best off offering fully informative demonstrations that divide the market and dampen price competition. In contrast, when a firm can adjust its demonstration strategy in response to prices, the firm prefers only partially informative demonstrations, designed to maximize its market share. Such a strategy can generate the monopoly profit for the innovative firm.

We also investigate the trade-off between product exchange and refund when consumer returns a product. We find interesting extensions to past research wherein UBP are returned less and result in greater exchange than refund.

Traditional insurance-premium determination (such as support vector machines) has not fully merged all e-commerce factors, such as the product-fit uncertainty of online shopping, that could affect both insurance demand and return quantity. Based on these traits, we develop a profit-maximization model in terms of certain market-reaction parameters, especially product-fit uncertainty, and calculate the optimal pricing strategy, including both the insurance premium and the compensation. Using prospect theory, we explain why online product review could influence insurance applicants’ risk-averse behavior in the e-commerce situation. Then we solve for the reasonable premium and compensation given online product reviews from the insurance company's perspective and obtain a number of managerial guidelines for using marketing and operational-strategy variables to influence those reaction parameters so as to obtain the maximum benefit from the market. Interestingly, when consumers’ sensitivity to product-fit uncertainty is moderate, an increase in product-fit uncertainty moves insurance premium and compensation in the opposite direction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Online product review; Product fit uncertainty; Return policy; Return-freight insurance,Commerce; Electronic commerce; Product design; Insurance companies; Insurance premiums; Online product reviews; Operational strategies; Product fit uncertainty; Profit maximization; Reaction parameters; Return policy; Insurance,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027404530

These findings extend the prior research through the verification from the empirical survey on the importance of product returns in the adoption of closed-loop supply chain activities, which eventually impacts the firm's effectiveness in the reverse supply chain. The findings also help managers to understand the factors that can improve the outcome of the adoption of closed-loop supply chain activities by intensifying the extent of involvement in product returns, which provides a valuable insight about a significant predictor of firm performance in reverse flow chains. © 2017",Activities; Closed-loop supply chains; Effectiveness; Product returns; Reverse supply chains,Environmental management; Environmental management systems; Information management; Manufacture; Surveys; Activities; Closed-loop supply chain; Effectiveness; Product returns; Reverse supply chains; Supply chains,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015745173

One way to understand this complex relationship is via cost of quality (COQ) studies. COQ is the sum of conformance and nonconformance costs, but the conformance-nonconformance dichotomy seems to be ambiguous and arbitrarily defined. The ambiguity in the conformance and nonconformance terminology prevents observing the relationship between innovation and quality management. In the current work that ambiguity is demonstrated via the analysis of a paradox between properly managing and reducing product returns in consumer electronics. Also, the inhibition mechanism preventing the ability to observe the abovementioned relationship is made visible.

It can extend the useful life of a product and help in reducing waste caused by a huge amount of short life-cycle products. Pricing decisions are an important aspect of successful remanufacturing and can secure the profitability of a firm. Remanufacturing for end-of-use products needs to cope with high uncertainties in terms of the quality and quantity of the acquired product returns. Therefore, after inspection, only a fraction of returns can be recovered through remanufacturing operations. This uncertainty in recovery yield influences the decisions impacting acquisition, wholesale, and retail prices. We propose a pricing model that accommodates the random yield effect of product returns on pricing decisions for short life-cycle products in a closed-loop supply chain. The system consists of a retailer, a manufacturer, and a collector of used-products. We apply a sequential decision approach to determine the optimum pricing decision to maximize supply chain profit, according to a pricing game that places the manufacturer as a Stackelberg leader. We demonstrate the effect of changing parameter values on the wholesale and retail prices as well as on the profitability. The results indicate that the profitability of each player and the supply chain as a whole is affected by the quality of the collected used products, the acquisition price, the shortage penalty, and the remanufacturing costs. Interestingly, reducing variance of random yield results in lower profit for the collector even though the other players and the whole supply chain are better off. © 2018",Pricing; Remanufacturing; Short life-cycle product; Yield of product return,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050400334

These products are then shipped to consumers’ home by a drop-shipper. Drop-shipping seems to be a good option to sell products in addition to physical stores. Furthermore, both types of products, either sold in store or on Internet can be returned by consumers, with often a higher return ratio for those purchased on Internet. To model these two sales channel and the interactions between them, we consider a News-Vendor (NV) managing both a physical store and an online sale channel that can be fulfilled by a drop-shipping option. We also consider the possibility of reselling products that are returned by consumers during the selling season. The concavity of the expected profit is proven and the optimality condition is obtained. Promising results are obtained from a numerical analysis. In particular, we show that the expected profit can be 14.4% less than the optimal expected profit if the return effect is ignored. Using drop-shipping option can reduce the optimal store inventory by 31.2% and if the NV has no drop-shipping option, the expected profit can be 9% less. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",drop-shipping; inventory management; News-Vendor; operational research; product returns,Drops; Electronic commerce; Inventory control; Profitability; Sales; Expected profits; Inventory management; News-Vendor; Newsvendor problem; Operational research; Optimality conditions; Physical stores; Product returns; Ships,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019187418

The SD model was then used to identify effective policies that could manage inventory, production and distribution flows in the PDS. Among these policies included the coupling of complementary recovery options and centralization of demand information. It was observed that these policies could actually smoothen the flow of production, which eventually leads to significant decreases in the inventory variances and amplifications in all echelons of the hybrid PDS. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Product recovery; Production-distribution system; Simulation; System dynamics,System theory; Demand information; Hybrid production; Modeling methodology; Policy development; Product recovery; Production-distribution systems; Simulation; System Dynamics; Recovery,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011115915

E-commerce offers consumers lower prices, wider product categories and a more convenient shopping experience. In addition, consumers seek ways to manage the risk that is often perceived when making purchases online, which is why retailers’ online return policies have become an increasingly important attribute through which companies compete. Lenient return policies fuel unnecessary ordering and increase return rates, which in turn has major implications both for consumer behaviour and for managing the increasingly complex ecological and economical issue of online returning. Despite its relevance, prior research has paid limited attention to this evolving phenomenon. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to explore and analyse online returning behaviour in the context of fashion merchandise. As a result, 10 categories of online returning behaviour are identified that capture the reasons why consumers actually return items they have ordered online. These categories are further linked with when the decision to return ordered items emerges.

The principle of non-refoulement provides that 'no country shall expel or return a refugee against his or her will, in any manner whatsoever, to a territory where he or she fears threats to life or freedom'.1 Following the increasing numbers of asylum seekers in the 1990s, host countries began to apply the Refugee Convention criteria more strictly and refused a growing number of applicants.2 Since the summer of 2015 Europe has found itself in the middle of what is described as a 'refugee crisis'. The crisis has brought debates about asylum, borders and return policies to the centre of the public and political conversation. A growing portion of society has called for a stricter asylum policy. This article will argue that even before this latest 'refugee crisis' discourses on asylum were becoming more restrictive, with a growing focus on return rather than protection. It will also show that the debates on asylum keep moving away from the definition provided in the 1951 Refugee Convention. It will do so by comparing the Belgian debates on forced return - and on asylum in general, which is inseparably connected to the subject - in the media and parliament during two periods: 1998-2001 and 2011-2013.3 In the first section, we will elaborate on the theoretical framework of the analysis, paying attention to relevant concepts and secondary literature, as well as to the research questions and methodology.

Well-known retailers benefit from offering generous return policies only for product categories that involve low levels of return effort.

Therefore, industries have to consider not only the activities in the forward supply chain but also in the reverse supply chain. An integrated supply chain, that combines the activities of both the forward and reverse supply chains, is referred to as the closed loop supply chain (CLSC). There are two main types of CLSC structures: hybrid and dedicated. In this research, we analyze the effect of carbon emissions consideration on the design of both hybrid and dedicated CLSCs. In particular, we develop a set of integrated mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models to quantify and compare both of the environmental and economic impacts of carbon emissions policies (carbon cap, carbon tax, and carbon cap-and-trade), and market factors (scale effect, product return rate, and the customer demand) on the design of CLSCs with respect to both CLSC structures. Our analysis shows that when market conditions are considered, total cost and total emissions are more sensitive to customer demand than to the scale effect and the product return rate. When an industry faces fluctuation on the quantity of the returned products, adopting a dedicated CLSC would lead to a lower total cost. Under cap-and-trade policy, dedicated CLSC can produce less total emissions. We also observe that dedicated CLSC is more cost efficient under carbon cap policy and hybrid CLSC is more emissions efficient when the carbon tax is introduced. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon emission; Carbon policy; Closed-loop supply chain; Supply chain design,Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Emission control; Integer programming; Product design; Carbon emissions; Carbon policy; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Environmental and economic impacts; Integrated supply chain; Mixed integer linear programming model; Supply chain design; Supply chains,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006339882

There is an ongoing debate about the impact of these changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) and its implications. Here we report results from an extensive study that provided direct evidence of cropland SOC sequestration in China. Based on the soil sampling locations recorded by the Second National Soil Survey of China in 1980, we collected 4,060 soil samples in 2011 from 58 counties that represent the typical cropping systems across China. Our results showed that across the country, the average SOC stock in the topsoil (0-20 cm) increased from 28.6 Mg C ha−1 in 1980 to 32.9 Mg C ha−1 in 2011, representing a net increase of 140 kg C ha−1 year−1. However, the SOC change differed among the major agricultural regions: SOC increased in all major agronomic regions except in Northeast China. The SOC sequestration was largely attributed to increased organic inputs driven by economics and policy: while higher root biomass resulting from enhanced crop productivity by chemical fertilizers predominated before 2000, higher residue inputs following the large-scale implementation of crop straw/stover return policy took over thereafter. The SOC change was negatively related to N inputs in East China, suggesting that the excessive N inputs, plus the shallowness of plow layers, may constrain the future C sequestration in Chinese croplands. Our results indicate that cropland SOC sequestration can be achieved through effectively manipulating economic and policy incentives to farmers. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

The firm needs to decide the optimal initial order quantity, option order quantity, and retail price simultaneously. The firm's joint optimal decisions are derived for both single- and multi-periods. We examine the impact of two typical forms of customer returns: proportional to product sold, and increasing with selling price. We demonstrate that when customer returns increase with products sold, the firm will set a higher price and reduce both initial order quantity and option order quantity through the wholesale price contract and option contract, respectively, for the single-period problem. In the multi-period problem, when customer returns increase with products sold, the impact of customer returns depends strongly on the variation in product purchase costs (order costs and purchase costs of options) in each period. When customer returns increase with selling price, however, the firm will cut its price, and initially order more products with fewer options for both the single- and multi-period problems. Furthermore, numerical examples confirm that the presence of customer returns results in a significant decrease in the firm's profit. Option contract can be a tool to mitigate the negative impact of customer returns as with the option contract, the more the customer returns, the more the firm is motivated to provide a returns policy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Customer returns; Join pricing and order decision; Option contracts,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027981478

The demand at the retailer's end depends on the retail price and quality of the product. Each manufacturer customizes his/her product to differentiate it from the other manufacturers’ products. Manufacturers compete with each other over price and quality in the presence of brand differentiation. In this set up, we consider two scenarios: (i) when customers do not have the facility of return and refund, and (ii) when customers do have the facility of return and get full refund. We analyze the pricing and quality management strategies of the manufacturers and the retailer in each scenario for centralized and decentralized systems. Through our study we find that brand differentiation increases retail price and quality of the product. We also see that, to make full refund policy more profitable than no return, reservation price has to be set higher. Using revenue sharing mechanism, we coordinate the decentralized system and make it a win-win situation for each party involved.

This work addresses the problem of how to assess and manage product returns costs using a risk analysis methodology. Online product returns are seen as a random phenomenon that fluctuates in severity over time, threatening the profitability of the online store. Therefore, the starting point is that this risk can be modeled as a future random stream of payments. Given one or many future time periods, we aim to assess and manage this risk by answering two important questions: (1) Pricing—or what dollar amount factored on top of the current price of goods sold online would cover the cost of product returns, and (2) Reserving—or how much capital does an online retailer need to reserve at the beginning of each period to cover the cost of online product returns. We develop our analysis for one period (a month) by a closed formula model, and for multi-period (a year) by a dynamic simulation model. Risk measurements are executed in both cases to answer the two main questions above. We exemplify this methodology using an anonymized archival database of actual purchase and return history provided by a large size US women’s apparel online retailer. © 2016, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",E-commerce; Online product return; Risk analysis; Risk management; Simulation,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981168996

When the exact possibility distribution is unavailable, it is required to develop a novel method to characterize the uncertain demand and deal with the corresponding supply chain coordination problem. This paper addresses the coordination problem for a three level supply chain in a single period model, where the uncertain demand is characterized by generalized parametric interval-valued possibility distribution. We define the lambda selection of uncertain demand, and discuss its parametric possibility distribution and mean value. In addition, we construct L–S measure by parametric possibility distribution of the lambda selection, and use it to define the L–S integral of uncertain profits under different scenarios. Under the risk-neutral criterion, we demonstrate that the mean supply chain profit in centralized decision is greater than the total mean supply chain profit in decentralized decision. Then a three level supply chain with revenue-sharing contract and return policy is studied and the analytical expressions of the optimal order quantity for different members are derived. Under the variable parametric possibility distribution of demand, we provide the sufficient conditions to ensure the three level supply chain can be fully coordinated and show the total mean profit of the channel can be allocated with any specified ratios among the members. Finally, we provide some managerial implications in a practical supply chain coordination problem.

Their efficiency and lifespan are strongly influenced by the use of appropriate lubrication systems, cleaning procedures and operator handling. Overuse of chemicals and detergents can result in belt degradation and corrosion. Excessive friction between the packages and the load bearing surface of the conveyors (e.g. belts or chains) can wear the packaging, delay start-ups and increase product waste. A suitably lubricated conveyor system increases longevity and promotes operational reliability. However, this has traditionally been achieved by using large amounts of water and harsh detergents. The solution proposed in this study comprises the formulation of a nanodiamond particle-loaded food-grade lubricating oil, a nanolubricant, for use on packaging transport and conveyor systems. Deployed in a ‘dry’ regime, the nanolubricant is hydrophobic; its viscosity is suitable to be sprayed, and a long shelf life ensures stable dispersions. Tribological performance on high-density polyethylene conveyor belts transporting aseptic carton packs was studied. When using the nanolubricant, wearing on the packages was reduced 60% compared with no lubricating conditions and 17% lower than current commercial solutions used for benchmarking purposes. The preparation of the nanolubricant using sonication technology presents efficiencies and carbon footprint reductions derived from lower energy consumption in the production process. This nanolubricant is an environmentally friendly solution for the maintenance of machinery for packaging and transporting and a novel mechanism to curb product returns due to aesthetic and structural damages on the packaging.

Customer demand is assumed to be dependent linearly on the retail price, and it is fulfilled by using both manufactured and remanufactured products. The manufacturer delivers the buyer’s order quantity in a number of equal-sized batches. The optimal number of shipments, the shipment size and the retail price are determined by maximising the average expected profit of the closed-loop supply chain. It is observed from the numerical study that high learning effects in production and inspection lead to high recovery rates of used products, which, besides an economic advantage, may have a positive effect on the environment. Even though forgetting has an adverse effect, the average expected profit of the closed-loop supply chain is much higher than that of the basic model which ignores worker learning. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Closed-loop supply chain; Learning and forgetting; Product inspection; Retail price; Stochastic product return,Costs; Inspection; Manufacture; Profitability; Sales; Ships; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Learning and forgetting; Product inspection; Product returns; Retail price; Education,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022043656

In recent years, because of increasing environmental concerns in societies and strict regulations of environmental protection, quite a number of manufacturers adopted remanufacturing strategy in their product development in response to the challenges. Remanufacturing of used products unavoidably involves a closed-loop supply chain system. To achieve the best outcomes, the supply chain design should be considered in product family design process. In this research, a multi-objective optimization model of integrated product family and closed loop supply chain design is formulated based on a cooperative game model for minimizing manufacturer's total cost and maximize suppliers’ total payoffs. Since the optimization problem could be a large- scale one and involves mixed continuous-discrete variables, a new version of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), namely cooperative negotiation embedded NSGA-II (NSGA-CO), is proposed to solve the optimization model. Simulation tests are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed NSGA-CO. The test results indicate that the proposed NSGA-CO outperforms NSGA-II in solving various scale of multi-objective optimization problems in terms of convergence. With the formulated optimization model and the proposed NSGA-CO, a case study of integrated product family and supply chain design is conducted to investigate the effects of environmental penalty, quantity of demand and marginal cost of remanufacturing on used product return rate, manufacturers’ and suppliers’ profits and joint payoff. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Multi-objective optimization; Negotiation; NSGA-II; Product family design; Remanufacturing,Chains; Environmental regulations; Genetic algorithms; Laws and legislation; Linear matrix inequalities; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Multi-objective optimization models; Multi-objective optimization problem; Negotiation; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); NSGA-II; Product family design; Remanufacturing; Product design,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017359351

This research examines the relationship between a gift-with-purchase promotion and consumer product returns, hypothesizing that consumers who purchase products that come with a free gift will be less likely to return the products. Evidence shows that a gift-with-purchase promotion reduces consumer product returns and that this relationship is mediated by perceived loss in returning a product. Then, the results indicate that the choice of free gifts reduces product return intention and that this relationship is serially mediated by perceived ownership and perceived loss. The findings further suggest that when consumers with high product involvement can select free gifts among alternatives, they tend to perceive more ownership and loss and thereby are less likely to return the promoted product.

Customers, however, cannot touch or feel a product before they purchase online. This leads to much higher rates of customer returns in the online channel, which in turn leads to significant costs to retailers. In this paper, we develop a model of a dual-channel structure with online and brick-and-mortar channels, in order to determine when a retailer should introduce an online channel and how it should define returns policies for the two channels. We identify the conditions under which a retailer should choose a dual-channel structure, and show that the retailer should offer a Money-Back Guarantee (MBG) in a channel as long as the net salvage value of the returned product is positive in that channel. In addition, if uniform pricing is used in both channels, it is optimal for the retailer to simply set the prices for each channel as if the two channels were operated separately. Our analysis leads to a simple three-step process to help the retailer make a channel selection, choose a product returns policy, and decide on price. We also examine the implications of personalized pricing (PP) in the online channel for the retailer's channel selection and choice of returns policy. We show that PP makes the online channel more attractive and makes the retailer more likely to adopt MBGs. The impact of PP on pricing for both channels is also discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Customer returns policy; Dual-channel; Personalized pricing; Uniform pricing,Costs; Channel selection; Customer returns policies; Dual channel; Dual-channel structures; Personalized pricing; Returns policies; Three-step process; Uniform pricing; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979781374

It provides a systematic analysis of the formation of exile communities and diaspora politics, the politics of return, and the agenda of democratization in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, focusing on the impact of intellectuals, academics, activists, and public figures who had experienced exile on the reconstitution and transformation of their societies following democratization. Readers are offered a kaleidoscope of intellectual itineraries, debates, and contributions held in the public domain by individuals who confronted and fought authoritarian rule. The book covers their contributions to the restructuring and transformation of scientific disciplines and of the humanities and the arts, as well as their collective institutional impact on higher education, science and technology, and public institutions. Bringing together sociopolitical, cultural, and policy analysis with the testimonies of dozens of intellectuals, academics, political activists, and policymakers, the book addresses the impact of exile on people’s lives and on their fractured experiences, the debates and prospects of return, the challenges of dis-exile and postexilic trends, and, finally, the ways in which those who experienced exile impacted democratized institutions, public culture, and discourse. It also follows some crucial shifts in the frontiers of citizenship, moving analysis to transnational connections and permanent diasporas, including the diasporas of knowledge that increasingly changed the very meaning of being national and transnational, while connecting those countries to the global arena. © Oxford University Press 2018.

Furthermore, we generate deeper insights about the moderating role of mobile shopping usage, product involvement and brand equity in this context. We answer our research questions by empirically analyzing a unique data set from a European fashion e-commerce company. This study links a wide range of transaction data (2.5 billion page clicks, 46 thousand different products, 700 brands, 40 product categories, 72 million sold and 33 million returned items) with a large set of OCRs (0.9 million). Our results show that positive OCRs can lead to lower return rates, higher sales after returns, and better conversion rates. Considering higher search costs on mobile devices, we reveal a weaker impact of OCRs in the mobile than in the desktop sales channel. Furthermore, in line with involvement theory, we see a significant impact of product involvement in this context such as the influence of positive OCRs is stronger for high-involvement products than vice versa. Moreover, we find support for statements from brand signaling literature, that OCRs matter more for weak than for strong brands. © 2017 Proceedings of the 25th European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2017.

In our setting, a manufacturer (Dell) sells new products in the first period and faces the threat of cannibalization in the second period from a Goodwill agency, which collects and refurbishes the manufacturer's goods and sells them as used products. Surprisingly, and unlike the findings from the marketing literature, cannibalization does not lower the manufacturer's sales in both periods; however, it does negatively impact the manufacturer's profits and positively affect the Goodwill agency's profits. We demonstrate that in an atypical CLSC, a reduction in the price of new products is never sufficient to counter the negative effect of cannibalization. We then introduce an advertising strategy, through which the manufacturer complements its pricing strategy, endogenizes the returns, and positively affects both the new and used product demands. Although the advertising strategy positively influences the product returns, it continues to be insufficient to counter the negative effect of cannibalization. Interestingly, we now find that cannibalization is detrimental even for the Goodwill agency, whose profits decrease when the cannibalization level exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, we show that when a “product resale value” option exists, the manufacturer can convert the cannibalization threat into a business opportunity and increase its profits, independent of an advertising strategy. Thus, the manufacturer should always collect through a Goodwill agency when sufficiently large resale value options exist. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cannibalization; DellReconnect project; Game theory; Product resale value; Product returns,Game theory; Marketing; Profitability; Sales; Supply chains; Business opportunities; Cannibalization; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); DellReconnect project; Product cannibalizations; Product resale value; Product returns; Manufacture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017652847

Additionally, an increasing number of manufacturers nowadays offer a return policy to attract more customers and to stay competitive. This paper studies a supply chain system, which is comprised of production, refurbishing, collection, and waste disposal processes. A return policy in which customers can return the purchased item for a refund is also considered. Two selling strategies, a single-channel strategy (i.e., a retail channel) and a dual-channel (i.e., a retail channel and an online channel) strategy are discussed from which mathematical models are developed. The purpose is to examine the effect of different return policies on the behavior of SC systems before and after adopting the dual-channel. In both strategies, the paper analyzes the change in the profit, the pricing and inventory decisions. Numerical examples and sensitivity analyses are provided with their results discussed. The findings of this paper demonstrate that in both strategies, the more generous the return policy is, the higher the demand, the selling prices and the overall profit. The findings also indicate that adopting a dual-channel strategy is more profitable to the supply chain. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Customization; Dual-channel; Refurbish; Return policy; Reverse logistics; Supply chain,Chains; Costs; Logistics; Manufacture; Numerical methods; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Waste disposal; Customization; Dual channel; Refurbish; Return policy; Reverse logistics; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012107831

However, at the same time, many customers tend to return products under this policy, which incurs considerable costs for retailers. The present research introduces a keep reward (i.e., providing incentives to keep a product) as a new promotion strategy to improve the conventional lenient policy. Drawing on operant conditioning, the authors propose and test the reinforcing effect of a keep reward on customers' keep decision, compared to the conventional lenient policy. Results of a qualitative pilot study suggest that a keep reward is generally feasible in online retailing practice, especially in the low- to mid-price segment and with rewards that are linked to future purchases. Two experimental studies verify the positive effect of a keep reward. Study 1 shows that it substantially increases keep intention compared to a conventional lenient policy. Study 2 shows that the effect on keep intention is moderated by customers' online shopping frequency, and this moderating effect is mediated by repurchase intention. In particular, the keep reward is most effective among frequent shoppers because they are more inclined to repurchase and thus, benefit from the reward. In summary, both studies support the keep reward as a valuable add-on to the conventional lenient policy because order intention remains comparably high, while keep intention is higher. Theoretical implications and recommendations for online retailers on how to implement a keep reward in different industries are discussed. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",online retailing; operant conditioning; product returns; return policies; rewards,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027328427

Here we develop a duopoly model to investigate the impact of the increasingly popular personalized pricing strategy (PPS) and the widely used Money Back Guarantee (MBG) customer returns policy. We consider two retailers who differ in customer satisfaction rates. Each retailer chooses a pricing strategy, PPS or uniform pricing, and a product return strategy, MBG or ‘no returns.’ We show that both PPS and MBG are dominant strategies, but their impact on retailers’ prices and profits are different; while PPS intensifies price competition and may lead to a prisoner's dilemma in which both retailers may lose profit, MBG mitigates price competition and may result in a Pareto improvement in both retailers’ profits. Both PPS and MBG increase the size of the overall market, but not the total duopoly profit. The total customer surplus and social welfare may increase under either strategy. In addition, we obtain some interesting observations as to how our results may change if the product quality/customer satisfaction rate is endogenously chosen in the duopoly. Some of our findings are in contrast to related results reported in the literature. © 2016 New York University",Customer returns; Duopoly; Game theory; Pricing,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009785708

Manual systems have been widely studied, but the operating policies may require significant changes for e-commerce settings. First, to maintain consumers’ loyalty, it is important to maintain delivery reliability even on the busiest days. When the number of order pickers in an area increases, however, more delays due to interactions may occur. For example, travel speed may need to be lowered when order pickers pass each other in narrow aisles. Second, many products sold through e-commerce are returned by consumers. Before these returned products can be sold again, they must be reintegrated in the stock. This paper presents hybrid genetic algorithms to determine routes for simultaneous pickup of products in response to consumers’ orders and delivery of returned products to storage locations. Furthermore, interactions between the order pickers are considered in the routing decisions. The developed algorithms use specific warehouse problem characteristics. We identify the mix of pickups and deliveries to realise the highest savings in practice. It is shown that order-picker interactions can be a significant cause for delay and should be accounted for in the routing. © 2016 The Author(s).

Among the factors that have resulted in the increase of returned products are defects in the films caused by the poor manipulation of materials and, above all, the hard point in the coils caused by excessive extruder preparation time, causing the extrusion head to overheat as well as uneven extrusion. Extrusion is a key process in the production of plastic materials as it transforms polypropylene and additives into plastic sheets. The delay in the preparation time caused by machine operators leads to the overheating of the extrusion head and, therefore, defective products that are ultimately returned to the company by customers. In order to confront this problem, a proposal was developed using the SMED tool of Lean Manufacturing in order to reduce the preparation time of the extruder and to increase the productivity of the company. For the validation of the proposal, we simulated the system to determine the resulting reduction in extruder preparation time. © Research India Publications.",Extrusion; Lean manufacturing; Preparation time; Productivity; Simulation; SMED,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051835924

The rapid evolution of online marketplaces has led to frequent product returns with variations across diversified businesses. These marketplaces have caused potential losses due to fraudulent returns, hence requiring a commitment of resources to RL. With information systems (IS) playing a role in improved supply chain performance, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of a conceptualized IS framework on achieving RL strategic outcomes, under the individual moderating influence of resource commitment (RC) and return frequency. Design/methodology/approach: Data have been collected through a questionnaire from top to middle management executives managing the supply chain, logistics and IS. Moderated regression analysis was conducted on the collected sample using Hayes’ (2013) process modeling. Findings: The study depicts that IS capability, IS for logistics, IS partnership quality and IS for value addition lead to RL strategic benefits. Also, return frequency and RC act as relatively strong moderators with a negative impact. When analyzed for the individual IS constructs, RC has a stronger moderating impact than return frequency. Practical implications: The IS usage framework can be used effectively by practitioners for enhancing strategic RL performances depending on variations in committed resources and return frequency for individual industries. Originality/value: The study proposes an IS usage framework for achieving enhanced RL strategic outcomes and emphasizes on the moderating role played by RC and return frequency for producing the results. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Information systems; Moderation; Resource commitment; Return frequency; Reverse logistics; Strategic performance,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042509903

If adherence is suboptimal, safety cannot be adequately assessed. MTN-017 was a phase 2, randomized sequence, open-label, expanded safety and acceptability crossover study comparing 1) daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF), 2) daily use of reduced-glycerin 1% tenofovir (RG-TFV) gel applied rectally, and 3) RG-TFV gel applied before and after receptive anal intercourse (RAI)—if participants had no RAI in a week, they were asked to use two doses of gel within 24 hours. Product use was assessed by mixed methods including unused product return count, text messaging reports, and qualitative plasma TFV pharmacokinetic (PK) results. Convergence interviews engaged participants in determining the most accurate number of doses used based on product count and text messaging reports. Client-centered adherence counseling was also used. Participants (N = 187) were men who have sex with men and transgender women enrolled in the United States (42%), Thailand (29%), Peru (19%) and South Africa (10%). Mean age was 31.4 years (range 18–64 years). Based on convergence interviews, over an 8-week period, 94% of participants had ≥80% adherence to daily tablet, 41% having perfect adherence; 83% had ≥80% adherence to daily gel, 29% having perfect adherence; and 93% had ≥80% adherence to twice-weekly use during the RAI-associated gel regimen, 75% having perfect adherence and 77% having ≥80% adherence to gel use before and after RAI. Only 4.4% of all daily product PK results were undetectable and unexpected (TFV concentrations <0.31 ng/mL) given self-reported product use near sampling date. The mixed methods adherence measurement indicated high adherence to product use in all three regimens. Adherence to RAI-associated rectal gel use was as high as adherence to daily oral PrEP. A rectal microbicide gel, if efficacious, could be an alternative for individuals uninterested in daily oral PrEP. © 2017, Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

The software tool was designed to be flexible enough to reproduce the geometry of any warehouse as a function of its main parameters, i.e. number of blocks, number of cross-Aisles, shape factor and total storage capacity. In the same tool, different routing policies have been embodied, including the traditional heuristic strategies (S-shape, return, largest gap and aisle-by-Aisle), as well as an ""advanced"" return policy that allows exploiting the cross-Aisles where available. The chosen context of analysis of these policies is that of manual, picker-To-parts, order picker systems. The effectiveness of the tool developed has been tested on a sample warehouse, of fixed storage capacity, where the software was used to compute the travel distance of the picker as a function of the routing policy, shape factors, number of aisles, number of cross-Aisles and size of the order picking list. The best policy, i.e. The policy that returned the shortest path, was identified for each warehouse configuration investigated.

Some consumers are willing to use this return option opportunistically for short-term consumption rather than its intended purpose of resolving fit uncertainty. Such behavior has been termed “wardrobing.” Restocking fees (partial refunds) can be used to combat wardrobing. However, there is a trade-off involved, since partial refunds will be viewed negatively by consumers who return an item due to a true lack of fit. In this study, we consider how the extent of wardrobing (how many consumers consider such behavior) and the benefit of wardrobing (how much value can be extracted during the trial) impact firm pricing decisions and profits in this retail context. Our results imply that an increase in the extent of wardrobing is most detrimental to profits when the current extent of wardrobing is low. On the contrary, if the extent of wardrobing is already very high, and the benefit of wardrobing to consumers is also high, the retailer can set prices and refunds such that additional wardrobing actually increases firm profits. In a model extension, we show how a retailer can effectively screen wardrobers from ordinary consumers by offering a menu of price/refund pairs, and that such an approach can lead to increased profits if the extent of wardrobing is sufficiently high. Overall, our findings provide new insights into how retailers can set prices and refund policies to effectively manage opportunistic behavior by consumers. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society",consumer returns; opportunistic behavior; retail operations; wardrobing,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013382577

There is a growing importance on recovery of used materials and products amongst industry players. The Malaysian government has conducted many green campaigns and provided incentives for some green practices; however, the adoption of product return and recovery management is still low amongst automotive manufacturers. Therefore, it is important to understand the obstacles towards product return adoption so that the countermeasures can be thought of to overcome this situation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the barriers of product return management amongst automotive manufacturing firms in Malaysia. A total of 228 automotive manufacturers and assemblers were identified as the sampling frame, which was selected based on the census sampling method due to the limited sample size of the study. The data was analysed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) with the measurement model had shown sufficient model fit and the structural model revealed that the data supported the hypothesised model. The large effect size and higher than zero values of the predictive capabilities imply that the model has sufficient variance explained for the predictive capability of the hypotheses testing of the study. Based on the results, this study has found that the resource barrier has a significant effect on the level of adoption of product returns. Specifically, the resource barrier and the extent of the manufacturing return adoption were positively related (β = 0.361, p < 0.01), resource barrier and the extent of the distribution returns (β = 0.252, p < 0.05), and resource barrier and the extent of the customer returns (β = 0.333, p < 0.01). The result reflects that automotive manufacturers have a lack of resources to afford the product return implementation; as a matter of fact, high initial investments in terms of finances, human resources, and time are required for the product return adoption. Other variables of the study, such as the attitudinal and perception barrier, information barrier, and technical barrier, were found to be insignificant with the adoption of product return management. As a conclusion, this study discovered that the resource barrier was the major obstacle that impeded the automotive manufacturers in Malaysia from adopting the product return management. The outcome is expected to help policy makers, manufacturers as well as stakeholders in setting appropriate policies and strategies to improve the product return and recovery management adoption. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Attitudinal and perception barriers; Information barrier; Product returns; Resource barrier; Technical barrier,Global warming; Least squares approximations; Recovery; Information barrier; Perception barriers; Product returns; Resource barrier; Technical barriers; Manufacture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994285359

Management of product returns is critical for the stability and profitability of a reverse supply chain. Forecasting the return amounts and timing is beneficial. The purpose of this paper is to develop a forecasting system for discarded end-of-life vehicles and to predict the number of end-of-life vehicles that will be generated in the future. To create the forecasting system, grey system theory, which uses a small amount of the most recent data, is employed. The accuracy of the grey model is improved with parameter optimization, Fourier series and Markov chain correction. The proposed models are applied to the case of Turkey and data sets of twelve regions in Turkey are considered. The obtained results show that the proposed forecasting system can successfully govern the phenomena of the data sets, and high accuracy can be provided for each region in Turkey. The proposed forecasting system can be used as a strategic tool in similar forecasting problems, and supportive guidance can be achieved. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",End-of-life vehicles; Forecasting; Grey modelling; Product returns,Turkey; Fourier series; Markov processes; Supply chains; System theory; Vehicles; End-of-Life Vehicles; Forecasting problems; Forecasting system; Grey system theory; Parameter optimization; Product returns; Reverse supply chains; Strategic tool; flow modeling; forecasting method; Fourier transform; Markov chain; optimization; profitability; Forecasting,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991210354

Design/methodology/approach: Four experiments and one survey study test hypotheses regarding how O-regret and S-regret influence NWOM through mediating mechanism of anger and sadness and how the impact of regret on NWOM is moderated by boundary conditions. Findings: The results show that consumers who experience O-regret transmit more NWOM than those who experience S-regret. Anger is a dominant emotion when consumers experience O-regret and mediates the impact of regret on NWOM, and sadness is a dominant emotion when consumers experience S-regret and mediates the impact of regret on NWOM. In addition, purchased price (full vs discount price), regret context (private vs public context) and return policy (strict vs lenient policy) are found to moderate the effect of regret on NWOM. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted in China, which has a unique business environment that may differ from other countries. Therefore, this research opens a new avenue to further examine such a phenomenon in countries where a more lenient return policy is a standard business practice. Cross-nation studies comparing how different return policies and other business environment conditions are warranted in future research. Practical implications: The study provides several insights for marketers considering the management of NWOM by understanding consumer O-regret and S-regret in either online or offline retailing situations. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the extant literature by distinguishing different outcome regrets. The theoretical conceptualization and empirical findings shed further lights on the relationship between regret and other negative emotions and how O-regret and S-regret lead to different impacts on NWOM through different paths of mediation mechanism. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Anger; Blame attribution; Negative word of mouth; Other-blame regret; Sadness; Self-blame regret,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036672382

However, while reverse logistics is becoming a mandatory element of the supply chain in developed countries particularly due to legislation issues, the subject is still in a state of infancy in emerging economies such as Brazil. In these connections, impediments to reverse logistics implementation must be considered and analyzed, as well as the many different perspectives from the key stakeholders for their development. The objective of this research is to evaluate the interrelationship among reverse logistics barriers from the perspectives of the most important stakeholders in the Brazilian context. For this purpose, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making tool named grey-based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (grey-DEMATEL) was used to extract a multiple company-customer-government association perspective. Three respondents – one expert from each stakeholder – have been consulted to obtain the pair-wise comparison of barriers. Thus, both the net effect and the importance level of each impediment are provided by means of a Euclidean distance analysis, as well as the similarities and differences among stakeholders’ opinions. The uniqueness of this paper relies on the fact that no previous work was found in the domain of multiple stakeholders’ perspective for reverse logistics barriers. This research uncovers that most of the key barriers from the reverse logistics multiple perspectives framework are from the organizational point of view. This stakeholder holds 10 out of 13 key barriers for RL implementation; as such, it is an important outcome because it indicates that firms may begin product return implementation by first tackling key internal barriers. Moreover, knowing the influential factors in their environment may assist industry managers to better implement and manage reverse flows, and to see through current and future green solutions for reverse logistics. © 2016",Barriers; Decision making; DEMATEL; Grey theory; Reverse logistics; Stakeholder,Brazil; Decision making; Decision theory; Supply chains; Barriers; DEMATEL; Grey theory; Reverse logistics; Stakeholder; decision making; implementation process; logistics; multicriteria analysis; stakeholder; case report; decision making; extract; government; human; manager; statistical model; Logistics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008498560

We capture new and remanufactured product sales, the evolution of the install base, and consumer return and repurchase decisions over the life cycles of new and remanufactured product. Our analyses lead to two main findings on the acquisition policies. First, if the buyback price is less than the margin of a new product, then a trade-in policy is likely to yield higher profit than a buyback policy. Second, we show that the profitability is highest when the time lag between the introduction of a new product and initial demand for a remanufactured version of the product is at or near the sweet spot, which is the age of the product at which the costs of acquisition and remanufacturing are at minimum. Further, when the time lag between the introduction of a new product and initial demand for its remanufactured version is near the sweet spot, then simple pricing methods are close to optimal. © Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals",product life cycle; remanufacturing; returns acquisition policy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019627662

Due to an increasing return policy abuse and return rate, many firms have altered their generous return policies to restrictive return policies to protect profits. However, it’s suggested that the restrictive return policy could also reduce customer satisfaction, increase the perceived risk, and thus negatively affect customers’ decision-making (Petersen and Kumar 2009). Therefore, even though manufacturers and retailers hate product returns, smart companies are accepting them as bitter pills to be swallowed (Petersen and Kummar 2012).

To address such decision-making challenges, we develop a theoretic model to derive the optimal shipping strategy and return service charge (RSC) for an online retailer under two decision scenarios, in which decisions on shipping strategy and RSC are made either jointly or separately. We find that the retailer is better off in joint decision scenario than in separate decision scenario; a shipping free strategy is usually accompanied by a higher RSC, while a shipping fee strategy is typically accompanied by a lower RSC. We also find that, market parameters (e.g., the base return quantity, product price, consumers' sensitivities of shipping fee on demand, RSC on demand and return quantity) have important effects on the retailer's decisions on shipping strategy and RSC. Our findings suggest that the retailer can benefit from taking positive actions toward influencing the market to determine the favorable shipping strategy and RSC. Furthermore, our results can provide theoretical explanations for widely used shipping strategies and RSCs within the context of no-reason return policies in online settings.

Understanding the impact of policies and interventions on obesity prevalence among young people can help determine statewide public health and policy strategies. This article describes a systems model, originally launched in 2008 and updated in 2014, that simulates the impact of policy interventions on the prevalence of childhood obesity in Georgia through 2034. Methods: In 2008, using information from peer-reviewed reports and quantitative estimates by experts in childhood obesity, physical activity, nutrition, and health economics and policy, a group of legislators, legislative staff members, and experts trained in systems thinking and system dynamics modeling constructed a model simulating the impact of policy interventions on the prevalence of childhood obesity in Georgia through 2034. Use of the 2008 model contributed to passage of a bill requiring annual fitness testing of schoolchildren and stricter enforcement of physical education requirements. We updated the model in 2014. Results: With no policy change, the updated model projects that the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents aged ≤18 in Georgia would hold at 18% from 2014 through 2034. Mandating daily school physical education (which would reduce prevalence to 12%) and integrating moderate to vigorous physical activity into elementary classrooms (which would reduce prevalence to 10%) would have the largest projected impact. Enacting all policies simultaneously would lower the prevalence of childhood obesity from 18% to 3%. Conclusions: Systems thinking, especially with simulation models, facilitates understanding of complex health policy problems. Using a simulation model to educate legislators, educators, and health experts about the policies that have the greatest short-and long-term impact should encourage strategic investment in low-cost, high-return policies. © 2017, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.",childhood obesity; obesity policy; systems modeling,Adolescent; Exercise; Female; Georgia; Health Policy; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Pediatric Obesity; Prevalence; Systems Analysis; adolescent; childhood obesity; epidemiology; exercise; female; health care policy; health promotion; human; legislation and jurisprudence; male; prevalence; procedures; psychology; system analysis,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038030368

This research deals with the problem of joint determination of the optimal selling price, refund policy and quality level for complementary products in an online purchasing. It is assumed that the demand of each product is a function of price, refund and quality level. Furthermore, return policy is also a function of refund and quality level; and return quantity of the products is affected by the return quantity of the other product.

Fashion became the fastest growing and most popular category of consumer goods bought online in the UK (Mintel 2012), but suffers from a high product return rate (Ratcliff 2014), largely due to the lack of try-on, touch and feel possibilities. Advances in image interactivity technology (IIT) such as 360° spin, zoom, catwalk videos and virtual fitting rooms enable fashion retailers to provide consumers with enhanced visual information to evaluate the properties of the item online and reduce perceived product risk (Blazquez 2014; Kim and Forsythe 2009; McCormick and Livett 2012; Merle et al. 2012). However, small fashion retailers may become caught between the ‘hard place’ of limited resources, which prevents them from investing in such innovative website technology, and the ‘rock’ of increasing expectations for website capability amongst consumers, whose appetites for and expectations of online shopping are stimulated by the activities of larger businesses with greater resources. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science.",Academic Inventor; Critical Success Factor; Stakeholder Group; Technology Adoption; Technology Transfer,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125200918

However, high fixed costs associated with dedicated reverse logistics equipment and infrastructure force many companies to outsource their reverse logistics operations to third-party reverse logistics providers. One of the important problems faced by third-party reverse logistics providers is the selection of the types of used products to be collected. In this study, a four-phase used product selection methodology is proposed. First, the quantitative and qualitative selection criteria are determined. Then the weights of the criteria are calculated using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. Next, simulation models are employed to determine the values of quantitative criteria. Finally, technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution ranks alternative used product types.

Since policymakers prefer ‘voluntary’ return, governmental programmes to support the return of migrants – Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) programmes – were developed as far back as the 1970s and have played an increasingly important role in migration policy over the last three decades. At the same time, general migration policy and welfare systems have undergone profound change, including in the meanings and connotations attached to social welfare, return support and return policy. This raises questions about the implications of these broader societal and policy changes for the widely implemented AVR programmes. In this article, we discuss the interpretation and evolution of AVR programmes by analyzing how one particular European country, Belgium, has developed its AVR programme over time. We explore the evolution of the programme's content, target group and institutional positioning, which shed light on its changing goals and are closely linked to a broader shift towards a ‘managerial’ approach to migration policy and the welfare state. We argue that return support may become decontextualized when it adopts ‘conditional entitlement’ as a central principle. This leads to strong differentiation, based on personal responsibility, between ‘deserving’ and ‘undeserving’ migrants, the levelling down of the support given to returnees, and a more coercive voluntary return policy in which social support is linked to deportation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Assisted voluntary return programmes; Belgium; Migration management; Return policy,Belgium; immigration policy; migration; policy analysis; return migration; voluntary approach,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954285341

Returns management is regarded as a part of supply chain management. However, the research in returns management has received much less attention. To bridge the gap, this study concerns key concepts from two important schools of thought, i.e. institutional theory and the resource-based view, to build up the research model. Design/methodology/approach: Retailers and maintenance providers in the 3C industry (computers, communication and consumer electronics) in Taiwan were surveyed, and the statistical methods of hierarchical and moderated regression were used to examine the relationships among institutional pressures, commitment of resources and returns management. Findings: Institutional pressures, comprising non-market and market pressures, affect the implementation of returns management (product return practices and product recovery practices). Commitments of resources positively and significantly moderate the relationship between the pressures imposed by non-market and market actors and product return practices and product recovery practices. Research limitations/implications: This study investigates only the factors that drive returns management. Future research can examine the relationship between the antecedents and consequences of returns management. Furthermore, returns management may become increasingly critical for firms to develop and perform corporate social responsibility (CSR). Therefore, future research can investigate the relationship between CSR practices and returns management. Practical implications: This research suggests that managers under institutional pressures should continually pay attention to the effects of external factors on returns management. Additionally, the results reveal that a commitment of resources can reinforce the relationship between the pressures imposed by non-market and market actors and the implementation of returns management. Under significant institutional pressures and resource constraints, managers may increase the effectiveness of returns management while attending to the concerns of non-market and market actors. Originality/value: This study presents a model that considers three major explicative variables: institutional pressures, resources commitment and returns management. It is the first investigation to integrate three streams of literature on institutional theory, the resource-based view and returns management. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Resource management; Supply-chain management; Taiwan,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982995326

Therefore, we adapt and enhance already existing forecasting approaches to situations where the e-tailer matches consumer returns with their date of sale and furthermore, where the consumer has to register the return first.

We present a numerical example to demonstrate the theoretical results of the developed model, and we also compare the optimal decisions to determine the best channel power structures considered.

Specifically, this paper investigates how supply chain managers can use inventory (seller-induced scarcity) and pricing (PL) levers to control product returns. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical data of sales and product returns from an internet retailer is analyzed to identify the scale of the effect that product scarcity and PL has on product returns. These factors are considered in developing a sales-return process model which is used with empirical data in a simulation study. The study evaluates changes in product returns for different policy settings related to PL and inventory levels. Findings of the simulation study are validated using statistical analysis of empirical data. Findings - PL and seller-induced product scarcity affect the rate of product returns; however, the scale of this effect depends on inventory and pricing decisions. The results identify an inflection boundary based on scarcity and PL levels which reverses this effect. This reversal is explained by underlying principles at play regarding buyers' valuation of the sale and corresponding product attributes. Practical implications - Supply chain managers in internet retail can leverage lower inventory under the seller-induced scarcity approach to improve revenues. However, reducing inventory levels beyond a threshold is counterproductive, due to an associated increase in product returns. Similarly, setting market competitive prices (PL) can help reduce product returns. Under the seller-induced scarcity condition, this effect is reversed for inventory levels below a threshold. Retailers can implement the methodology developed in this paper to identify the inventoryprice threshold that can help increase revenues while keeping the rate of product returns at a manageable level. Originality/value - This research extends prior work regarding the role of product scarcity and pricing on product returns and develops a deeper understanding of how these factors can be managed to control product returns in the internet retail setting. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Induced scarcity; Internet retail; Inventory decisions; Pricing; Product returns,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982855382

Designing a closed-loop supply chain for recycling or reuse operations will support social responsibility and competitive advantage. However, in order to establish supply chains for sustainability, it is necessary to consider not only environmental benefits but also economic efficiency. Moreover, both the quantity of demand and returns are indefinite in an actual closedloop supply chain.

Design/methodology/approach: Three studies examined how informing consumers they may (reversible condition) or may not (irreversible condition) revise their personal information in the future affected their propensity to disclose personal information, compared to a control condition. Findings: Study 1 (which included three experiments with different time intervals between initial and revised disclosure) showed that consumers disclose less in both the reversible and irreversible conditions, compared to the control condition. Studies 2 and 3 showed that this is because consumers treat reversibility as a cue to the sensitivity of the information they are asked to divulge, and that leads them to disclose less when reversibility or irreversibility is made explicitly salient beforehand. Practical implications: As many marketers are interested in hoarding consumers’ personal information, privacy advocates call for methods that would ensure careful and well-informed disclosure. Offering reversibility to a decision to disclose personal information, or merely pointing out the irreversibility of that decision, can make consumers reevaluate the sensitivity of the situation, leading to more careful disclosures. Originality/value: Although previous research on reversibility in consumer behavior focused on product return policies and showed that reversibility increases purchases, none have studied how reversibility affects self-disclosure and how it can decrease it. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Personal information; Privacy; Reversibility; Self-disclosure,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991510917

Existing literature, based on signaling theory, suggests that money-back guarantees (MBGs) will be utilized by high-quality firms. But nowadays, almost all the e-tailers offer MBGs, that is to say, the story of ""clicks-and-mortar"" goes not the same way as the traditional ""bricks-and-mortar"". To understand this phenomenon, we develop a stylized two-segment market setting, to find in which situation MBGs can greatly improve the profit. Our model captures important features of MBGs sales including demand uncertainty, consumer valuation uncertainty, consumer returns and so on. We show that selling with MBGs increases e-tailers' sales and profit. Furthermore, MBGs is the best returns policy for mid-quality e-tailers under certain technical cost and returns hassle. In addition, adding compensation for MBGs returns policy is usually the strategy of low-quality e-tailers to reduce returns rate. © 2016, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

The current research attempts to fill the gap by focusing on two factors that shape consumer purchase behavior: (1) whether purchases are planned or unplanned, and (2) whether hedonic or utilitarian motivations drive purchases. The findings show that purchase plans and buying motivations have distinctive and interactive impacts on pre-purchase concerns, self-estimated likelihood of returning purchases, and purchase intentions with or without return policies. When hedonic motivation drives purchases, unplanned (vs. planned) purchases lead to higher return concerns, higher return likelihood, and lower buying intentions. When utilitarian motivation drives purchases, planned and unplanned purchases have comparable return concerns, return likelihood, and buying intentions. This interaction effect on buying intentions dissipates when a lenient return policy is offered. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Hedonic/utilitarian shopping; Product return; Return policy; Unplanned purchase,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939195039

The introduction of entrepreneurship courses in tertiary institutions of learning in Nigeria is a similar practice in many developing countries. The aim is to generate self-employment among youths and employment generation for others. This is due to poverty and unemployment in the country where most parents could not access study scholarships for their children to study in universities thereby making the students self-sponsored. This is one reason students seek low-priced products online. However, the issue here is: do academic entrepreneurs only depend on conventional markets for their raw materials, current business information, and sales avenues for their product or do they operate online to some degree? If they do, what factors influence their online business transactions? The study adopted a survey method to solicit responses from 293 final year university business students in the north, east and west regions of Nigeria. Stratified proportionate random sampling was adopted and data were analyzed using hierarchical regression. One of the findings suggest that academic entrepreneurs in Nigeria perceived price reduction and after-sales service advertising as critical factors influencing their online purchase behavior. The authors recommend, among others, that policymakers should encourage online vendors to provide after sales service information, such as return policy, for customers. © 2016, Allied Academies.

Moreover, based on the comparative analysis of equilibrium profits in each scenario, we derive the Nash equilibrium strategies of the game of the selection of return policy and explicitly propose the conditions for guaranteeing these equilibria.

In order to meet requirements, these firms carry out collection activities and provide incentive offers to attract product returns. These product returns may then undergo recovery options such as refurbishing, remanufacturing, cannibalizing, and controlled disposal. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model for a closed-loop supply chain that includes decisions for collection activities, incentive offers, and recovery options is formulated and validated. Quantity is modeled as a function of incentive offers between the collection centers and consumers, while quality of product returns follows an arbitrary probability distribution based on the incentive level. Quality of product returns dictates the possible recovery options, which these products can undergo. The model is then subjected to scenario analysis, which identified conditions wherein rebate or discount incentives are preferred, and when low or high incentive levels are favored. High stockout costs to secondary consumers encouraged the model to perform more cash rebate activities to stimulate more product returns. Meanwhile, when both the costs of activities and stockouts are high, the model is induced to carry out discount activities as this would generate sales rather than the cash rebate which simply incentivizes the participation in the take-back program. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Closed-loop supply chain; MINLP; Optimization; Product recovery,Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Probability distributions; Quality control; Recovery; Supply chains; Arbitrary probability distribution; Closed-loop supply chain; MINLP; Mixed integer nonlinear programming models; Product recovery; Quality of product; Scenario analysis; Secondary consumers; Costs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979948640

Approximately 8.8 % of all retail products are returned, costing US firms billions of dollars per year. In response to the significant impact returns can have on the bottom line, firms have begun to leverage their supply chain relationships to facilitate improved management of returns and obtain an advantage over competitors. Developing a competency in product returns can be an important part of a firm’s supply chain strategy and transform returns in to a profit center by extending the productivity of materials, resources and labor. Firms like Xerox, Canon, Estée Lauder, Caterpillar, Nike, and others have all found ways to utilize returns to positively impact performance. The research undertaken here investigates constructs that continue to deserve attention as they are central to the supply chain management discipline. Through collaboration firms can improve their ability to handle returns, but our research introduces information technology as providing a moderating influence over the impact of collaboration in the advancement of a returns competency. One way firms maximize the advantages they receive from collaboration is through enhanced information sharing via the use of information technology. Specifically, we posit that information technology enhances the impact of collaboration through the information sharing that takes place between firms as they develop a competency in information technology operations. Our work develops a theoretical framework and three research hypotheses. An empirical study involving 267 firms is discussed where the hypotheses are tested.

Reverse logistics activities include product collection, inspection and sorting, disposition (reuse, repair, remanufacture or recycle), and redistribution of products. One of the important decisions is whether such activities must be outsourced partly or all must be outsourced or nothing must be outsourced. The articles on the selection of third party reverse logistics service providers are abundant but the articles on outsourcing reverse logistics fully or partly are very limited. The proposed study develops a framework for outsourcing decisions in reverse logistics by using graph theoretic approach. The ability of graph theoretic approach to consider interdependencies and maintaining hierarchical relationship among attributes and sub-attributes makes it an attractive approach. The attributes and sub-attributes were selected by combining four traditional balanced scorecard perspectives i.e. stakeholder, internal business process, learning and growth, and finance with triple bottom line aspects of sustainability known as sustainable balanced scorecard. By considering sustainable balanced scorecard based attributes and sub-attributes, organizations can ensure their contribution toward sustainability even after outsourcing the reverse logistics activities. The proposed framework is illustrated by case example of a mobile manufacturing firm. Scenario based alternatives were developed and ""outsourcing index"" were calculated for all the alternatives by evaluating permanent function using graph theoretic approach.

End-of use product returns have two impacts. First, they lead to a decrease in the production cost, as manufacturing with used parts is cheaper than using virgin materials. Second, returns boost sales through replacement items. We show that the coordinated solution can be implemented by using so-called incentive strategies, which have the property of being best-reply strategies if each player assumes that the other is also implementing her incentive strategies.

Based on the product return data collected from online customers, a questionnaire was formulated and a study was done in Bangalore with 1000 people in the age group of 18 to 30 years to understand why people shop online for apparels and the issues faced by them. The questionnaire analysis showed that 42% of fashion apparel was returned because they were not the right size or fit, 19% were returned because of fabric quality issues, and 8% were returned because of problems with colour. A study was also conducted by observation and personal interviews with 150 customers at various offline stores in Bangalore for the identification of attributes related to the issues of size and fit. The problem areas identified in women-wear were issues with waist, bicep/sleeves, and chest. To combat these problems, various design ideas were proposed, and the selected designs were constructed and tested on a population of 100 women in the age group of 18 to 30 years of different body shapes for size and fit. It was concluded from the results that if the garments be created in such a way that it can fit many people of varying body shapes, it can drive businesses to improve the overall customer experience by reducing rampant returns of apparel. © 1964 - 2017.",Apparel E-Commerce; Apparel returns; Design thinking; Garment curation; Pleated front and back; Size and fit problem; Size chart; Sleeve-Bodice combinations design,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027552933

Each echelon, apart from its usual operations in the forward SC (FSC), has its own reverse logistics (RL) operations. We assume that RL information is transparent to the FSC, and the same replenishment policies are used throughout the supply chain. We focus on the impact on dynamic performance of uncertainties in the return yield, RL lead time and the product consumption lead time. Two outcomes are studied: order rate and serviceable inventory. The results suggest that higher return yield improves dynamic performance in terms of overshoot and risk of stock-out with a unit step response as input. However, when the return yield reaches a certain level, the classic bullwhip propagation normally associated with the FSC does not always hold. The longer remanufacturing and product consumption lead times result in a higher overshoot and a longer time to recover inventory, as well as more oscillation in the step response at the upstream echelons. We also study bullwhip and inventory variance when demand is a random variable. Our analysis suggests that higher return yield contributes to reduced bullwhip and inventory variance at the echelon level but for the CLSC as a whole the level of bullwhip may decrease as well as increase as it propagates along the supply chain. The reason for such behaviour is due to the interaction of the various model parameters and should be the subject of further analytical research. Furthermore, by studying the three-echelon CLSC, we produce a general equation for eliminating inventory offsets in an n-echelon CLSC. This is helpful to managers who wish to maintain inventory service levels in multi-echelon CLSCs. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",APIOBPCS; Bullwhip; Closed-loop supply chain; Dynamic performance; Inventory variance; Remanufacturing,Logistics; Manufacture; Mechanisms; Step response; Supply chains; APIOBPCS; Bullwhip; Closed-loop supply chain; Dynamic performance; Inventory variance; Remanufacturing; Linear matrix inequalities,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994226082

However, insufficient investment and inefficient supply chains have hampered the viability of reuse and/or recycling because of the extended time intervals between the recycling process of recovery and reuse. Manufacturers and distributors face the challenge and necessity to reduce these process delays in order to recover the maximum value of the returned products through an effective, responsive closed loop supply chain (CLSC). This paper quantitatively measures the effective responsiveness of the CLSC model in terms of time and energy efficiency. The proposed multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MOMILP) model evaluates delay parameters with decision variables that maximize profit, optimize customer surplus and minimize energy use. The model suggests decision makers may achieve an optimal tradeoff among differing objectives in a multiple-objective CLSC scenario. We employed a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) approach to solve the proposed MOMILP model and compared our approach with the Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for optimal solution. Results of the comparative evolutionary approaches shows that MOPSO outperforms NSGA-II in almost all cases in achieving the best trade-off solutions. Sensitivity analysis carried out to test the robustness of the model confirms that substantially less cost is feasible through the reduction of return process delays. This paper aims to formulate a multi-objective CLSC problem based on a network-flow model measuring the time value to recover maximum assets lost due to delay at different stages of the recycle process. We also developed a particle swarm approach for a multi-objective CLSC. Our study also offers valuable insights for designers wishing to create a product flow network with an optimal capacity level in case of prioritized objectives scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Closed loop supply chain; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization; Product recovery; Time-sensitive product returns,Computer system recovery; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Investments; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chain networks; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Insufficient investments; Mixed integer linear programming; Multi objective particle swarm optimization; Product recovery; Product returns; Multiobjective optimization,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973131343

The system is designed to satisfy the demands of different classes of single level products by remanufacturing end-life returned products. A single machine with a limited capacity in each time period is used to perform the remanufacturing operations. A mathematical programming formulation is proposed for the considered problem: the proposed model minimizes the sum of remanufacturing costs over a finite planning horizon. The problem is a generalized version of the classical capacitated dynamic lot sizing problem, and thus it is NP-hard itself. Therefore, a simulated annealing algorithm, with an efficient neighborhood generation which takes into account the constraints of the problem, is proposed as a solution approach. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, a set of experimental instances are generated and solved. The comparison between the results obtained with the proposed simulated annealing approach and the ones generated by the CPLEX solver shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2016",Capacitated lot sizing; Meta-heuristics; Optimization; Production planning; Remanufacturing; Simulated annealing,Mathematical programming; Optimization; Production control; Capacitated lot sizing; Dynamic lot-sizing; Finite planning horizon; Meta heuristics; Production Planning; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing system; Simulated annealing algorithms; Simulated annealing,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992426131

Logistics services in the related warehouses have to be enhanced accordingly in order to handle the huge amount of e-orders in a shorter timeframe. Moreover, since the e-retailing of packaged food has been getting popular, these warehouses inevitably have to handle food products requiring special care, including temperature, humidity and insolation control, and expiry date management. Consequently, suitable storage guidelines have to be formulated for these warehouses to cope with their more demanding daily operations. A cloud-based location assignment system (CLAS) is thus proposed in this article, which provides timely and comprehensive solutions to the storage location assignment problem for warehouse operators. CLAS applies (i) cloud-based infrastructure for enhancing the agility of the proposed system, (ii) fuzzy association rule mining for predicting the potential storage time of various types of packaged food, and (iii) fuzzy logic and association rule mining for offering the most preferred storage locations of various products. A prototype of the CLAS is tested in a warehouse which involves packaged food handling. The test results show that the operational efficiency measured in terms of storage assignment decision-making time and order-picking time and the quality of the storage assignment solutions measured in terms of product disposal rate and product return/exchange rate have been improved in the case company. © The Author(s) 2016.",Cloud-based decision support system; e-fulfillment; Fuzzy reasoning; Packaged food industry; Storage location assignment problem,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034806598

Grassland agriculture, as an important part of modern agriculture, connects the grassland with livestock, and maximizes plant productivity and animal product yield while minimizing environmental disturbance. Grassland agro-ecosystems incorporate four production components, and the animal production component is one of these and also an important criterion in determining production efficiency. Based on data for 31 provinces and cities in China from 1992 to 2011, this issue was analyzed and conclusions drawn. Firstly, according to national and provincial data, animal production and the contribution of agriculture to GDP have increased. The data basically can be divided into three stages from 1992 to 2005, 2005 to 2006, and 2007 to 2011 which align with successive agricultural policies. Secondly, from the perspective of the emerging trends for animal production, the major agricultural provinces have a higher contribution to GDP from animal production. For other cities, due to either a small contribution of animal husbandry to economic development or low animal product returns, contribution of animal production to GDP is relatively small. Thirdly, the fastest-growing areas for animal production are also in most cases major agricultural provinces. This may be due production of stock feed required to develop animal production. Fourthly, animal production GDP and other economic indicators are positively correlated. Because of different endowment of resources and different policies, the situation differs in different provinces and cities. This suggests China's grassland agriculture still has many problems. In order to support the development of agriculture, the government should consultatively review policy, and vigorously support the development of grassland agriculture.

However, it is controversial in judging their practical value. In the literature, various theoretical and modeling explanations of why the return policy is used in practice and is preferred by the retailer and manufacturer have been put forth. The literature focusing on the channel agents' risk attitudes to explain the adoption seems to have led to the conclusion that the two agents' preferences for adopting the full-return policy over the no-return policy are always in conflict, and thus the risk attitudes do not explain the adoption of return policy in practice. In this paper, we reinvestigate this issue. We first identify two distinct phases of risk averseness, high or low, for each of the two agents. We show distinct behaviors of how the wholesale price and order size are set in each phase. Then, we show that the full-return policy can be preferred over the no-return policy by both the agents if both of them are high risk averse. This implies that the agents' risk attitudes can explain the adoption of return policy. This is a new theoretical result, which is contrary to the existing understanding in the literature. Our result highlights the importance and intricacy of channel policies especially when the risk attitudes of agents are considered. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In practice, most retailers implement a full-refund policy, but the terms of customer returns policies vary. A customer returns policy serves as a post-customer service, and is a determinant factor in the customers decision to purchase the product, in addition to other factors, such as the price of the product. In this paper, for competing retailers who face customer returns, competition from multiple retailers and uncertain customer valuations of the product, we develop a model to examine when retailers can survive and what pricing strategy they should implement in a competitive market. We identify the co-existence conditions for multiple retailers and the existence conditions of a Nash equilibrium among competing retailers. We also show the impact of customer returns on the retailers pricing and market share, as well as on profits in a competitive market.

This study is a first attempt to empirically analyze and describe the effects of returns policies on consumer behavior and the moderating effects of the policies on profitability. The method involves analyzing the transactional data of a Swedish online fashion retailer. The results of the regression analyses show that with a lenient returns policy, repeat customers generate a significantly higher contribution per order, while returners and customers who enjoy free returns generate a significantly lower contribution per order. In addition, returners and repeat customers generate a significantly higher total contribution, while customers who enjoy free returns generate a significantly lower total contribution. Hence, returns policies that are free of charge do not necessarily benefit retailers in terms of long-term profitability.

Additionally, it explored the link between willingness to purchase again, switching costs and product returns management. Modern customers are more likely to switch suppliers; however, previous research suggests that this behaviour can be attenuated by a robust returns management experience. The purpose of this study was to provide a revised model of B2B repeated purchase intent that integrates the concept of product returns management and switching costs with existing B2B customer repurchase intent models. Design/methodology/approach: First, a qualitative inquiry based on semi-structured interviews was conducted to test and develop a quantitative survey. Then a survey was then sent to business owners operating in the audiology industry. Finally, there were 317 responses. Findings: The authors reveal the complex relationship between returns management and repeated purchase intent. Specifically, the authors’ results indicate that the effect of product returns on repurchase intent is opposite to the effect of customer value, depending on the value of customer value. The authors’ findings indicate that even when switching costs are low, firms can positively impact the intent to purchase again in the future if they increase the level of customer satisfaction. In addition, the authors’ findings indicate that in the context of B2B a high/low level of customer satisfaction does not trigger a positive effect of managing product returns on repurchase intent. Originality/value: This study was the first to introduce the concept of product returns management to research on B2B repurchase intent. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business-to-Business marketing; Customer satisfaction; Customer value; Product returns; Switching costs,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020381021

In India also, there are high turnovers and growing demand of electronics product especially after post liberalization in early nineties. These products generate e-waste which has become big environmental issue. Industries can handle these e-waste and product returns efficiently by developing reverse logistics (RL) system. A thorough study of critical success factors (CSFs) and their ordered implementation is essential for successful RL implementation. The aim of the study is to review the CSFs, and to prioritize them for RL implementation in Indian electronics industry. Twelve CSFs were identified through literature review, and discussion with the experts from the Indian electronics industry. Fuzzy-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach is proposed for prioritizing these CSFs. Perusal of literature indicates that fuzzy- TOPSIS has not been applied earlier for prioritization of CSFs in Indian electronics industry. Five Indian electronics companies were selected for evaluation of this methodology. Results indicate that most of the identified factors are crucial for the RL implementation. Top management awareness, resource management, economic factors, and contracts terms and conditions are top four prioritized factor, and process capabilities and skilled workers is the least prioritized factor.

Therefore, this paper reviews the literature on the modeling of reverse logistics inventory systems that are based on the economic order/production quantity (EOQ/EPQ) and the joint economic lot size (JELS) settings, so as to systematically analyze the mathematics involved in capturing the main characteristics of related processes. The literature is surveyed and classified according to the specific issues faced and modeling assumptions. Special attention is given to environmental issues. In addition, there are indications of the need for the mathematics of reverse logistics models to follow current trends in 'greening' inventory and supply-chain models.

A strategy currently utilised by the New Zealand dairy industry to optimise the value of exports is to incorporate imported lactose along with local milk to maximise the production of whole milk powder (WMP) while complying with the Codex Alimentarius (Codex) standards, in addition to increasing the exported product for every litre of milk. This study investigated the impact of different product portfolio strategies on lactose requirements for the Irish and New Zealand dairy industries for current and predicted 2020 milk output projections. A mass balance processing sector model that accounts for all inputs, outputs and losses involved in dairy processing was used to simulate the processing of milk into WMP, skim milk powder (SMP), cheese, butter and fluid milk of different proportions. All scenarios investigated projected an increase in production and revenue from 2012 to 2020. Higher cheese production reduced industry lactose demand through whey processing, while scenarios reliant on an increase in the proportion of WMP were associated with increased lactose deficits. © 2016, Teagasc.

We propose a methodology and implement a software program, Dataconda, to automatically mine a relational database. The user selects a class attribute contained in a table of the database and the procedure builds and selects predictors by exploring the whole database and aggregating information, without any user intervention. For example, our procedure may find that the best predictor for 'product return' is the proportion of products returned by the same customer in the past, even if the user has not built any such attribute. Our procedure produces more expressive attributes than existing methods.

However, there is few researches about competition & cooperation between the upstream MP firm (module manufacturer) and downstream CP firm (assembler) under MC supply chain scenario. From supply chain perspective, this paper first develops the base models considering the influences of return policy, modularity level, production lead time and pricing factors. Furthermore, according to the different decision-making situations, three kinds of MC supply chain models in competitive or cooperative environment (i.e. simultaneous-move game, sequential-move game and the cooperative game) have been built, then, the optimal solution of each model have been analyzed and compared, and coordination mechanism is design to cooperate in MC supply chain via profit-sharing with Nash bargaining power. Finally, through the numerical analysis, we find the highest profit is from the cooperative setting, then followed by in simultaneous-move and sequential-move one, the reason is that the lowest product price and the largest market demand easily occurs in the cooperative game compared with the others, the upstream module manufacturer takes advantage of MP to increase the modularity level and decrease manufacturing cost for the whole supply chain, the downstream assembler task is to shorten the lead time according to customer’s needs, while the wholesale price in cooperative game higher than simultaneous-move game and sequential-move game can ensure each firm’s benefits, effectively prevent from the effect of double marginalization and obtain Pareto optimality. © 2016 the authors.",lead time; Mass customization; modularity; return policy; supply chain,Compensation (personnel); Computer aided manufacturing; Costs; Decision making; Flexible manufacturing systems; Game theory; Manufacture; Pareto principle; Profitability; Wages; Cooperative environment; Coordination mechanisms; Double marginalization; Leadtime; Mass customization; modularity; Return policy; Supply chain models; Supply chains,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995614852

The introduction of reverse supply chains has created many challenges in network design, transportation, selection of used products, selection and evaluation of suppliers, performance measurement, marketing-related issues, end-of-life (EOL) alternative selection, remanufacturing, disassembly, and product acquisition management, to name a few. Under the guidance of an expert editor and with contributions from pioneers in the field, Reverse Supply Chains: Issues and Analysis addresses several important issues faced by strategic, tactical, and operation planners of reverse supply chains, using efficient models in a variety of decision-making situations providing easy-to-use mathematical and/or simulation modeling-based solution methodologies for a majority of the issues. The book introduces the basic concepts of reverse logistics and systematically analyzes the literature by classifying more than 400 published references into five major types of product returns. It then identifies the basic activities and scope of reverse logistics, examining its drivers and barriers as well as major issues and challenges. The chapters cover metrics for quantitatively comparing competing new-product designs for end-of-life disassembly on a reverse production line, how to use the theory of constraints thinking processes to determine the core problems in reverse logistics, and an integrated multi-criteria decision-making methodology using Taguchi loss functions AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy programming. They explore issues associated with remanufacturing and green and resilient supply chain management and propose system modeling based on graph theory and network flows application to analyze material resource flows in the life cycle of a product.

In the paper, we study a manufacturer Stackelberg supply chain in which a retailer can sell either or both of two brands, a well-known brand and a new brand, in a market supplied by two manufacturers. The two brands are differentiated by customer satisfaction rate. The supply chain involves both vertical competition between the retailer and manufacturers, and horizontal competition between the two manufacturers. We identify the conditions under which the retailer should choose one or both of the two manufacturers, and we show that in certain circumstances, the retailer will prefer to work with both manufacturers, even though one brand of product may have no sales. We find that whether a money-back guarantee (MBG) returns policy should be offered for the supply chain depends only on whether or not the retailer can recover the value of the returned product efficiently, even when the retailer incurs a net cost by accepting returns. We also show that an MBG enhances the profit of the manufacturer with low satisfaction rate, resulting in an increase in both the wholesale price and demand, but it has an opposite impact on the manufacturer with high satisfaction rate.

Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships that may exist among consumers’ perceptions of perishability, scarcity, low price, attitudes, impulse buying, post-purchase emotions, and product returns within the context of the fast fashion environments. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 246 usable questionnaires completed by female undergraduate students, who made purchases and product returns at fast fashion retailers, were analysed in SPSS and AMOS 23.0. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the hypotheses. Findings: Consumers who are attracted to scarcity due to limited supply and scarcity due to time, referred to as perceived perishability, have a positive attitude towards the fast fashion retailers in which products are presented in scarce environments. Likewise, consumers have a positive attitude towards fast fashion retailers due to low priced merchandises they offer. Consequently, consumers who have a positive attitude towards the fast fashion retailers are likely to purchase products from them impulsively. Moreover, impulse buying behaviour positively influenced some negative post-purchase emotional responses, which in turn positively influenced product returns in the fast fashion environments. Research limitations/implications: The results of the current study contribute to a greater understanding of apparel-related consumer behaviour in general. A theory formation of fast fashion consumer behaviour from acquisition to disposal can be drawn from the results of this study. Because some fast fashion retailers do sell clothing for both men and women, researchers could compare the responses of males and females to examine differences in consumer behaviour related to demographic characteristics. In the future, an examination of actual emotional responses and return behaviour would be beneficial for a more complete understanding of post-purchase consumer behaviour. Practical implications: Fast fashion retailers could use this information to carefully design shopping environments that induce impulse buying behaviour because it may result in product returns. Fast fashion retailers need to understand the causes of the return behaviour, whether consumer related or product related, to better meet the needs of their target market. Return policies must be considered. Originality/value: This research is the first to examine the impact of negative emotions following consumers’ impulse buying on product returns in the fast fashion retail environments. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Fast fashion; Impulse buying; Perishability; Post-purchase emotional response; Product returns; Scarcity,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010692146

In contrast, this paper addresses the challenges to focus on remanufacturing through component recovery, so as to solve production planning problems of hybrid remanufacturing and manufacturing systems. To deal with the uncertainties of quality and quantity of product returns, the processing time of remanufacturing, remanufacturing costs, as well as market demands, a robust optimisation model was developed in this research and a case study was used to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency. To strengthen this research, a sensitivity analysis of the uncertain parameters and the original equipment manufacturer’s (OEM’s) pricing strategy was also conducted. The research finding shows that the market demand volatility leads to a significant increase in the under fulfilment and a reduction in OEM’s profit. On the other hand, recovery cost reduction, as endogenous cost saving, encourages the OEM to produce more remanufactured products with the increase in market demand. Furthermore, the OEM may risk profit loss if they raise the price of new products, and inversely, they could gain more if the price of remanufactured products is raised. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",production planning; remanufacturing; robust optimisation model; uncertainty,Commerce; Cost reduction; Planning; Production control; Profitability; Quality control; Recovery; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Original equipment manufacturers; Production Planning; Remanufactured products; remanufacturing; Robust optimisation; Uncertain parameters; uncertainty; Optimization,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958523796

One popular way is to issue different kinds of certificates (or seals) for sellers, e.g., a quality certificate for sellers who have a lower product return rate than others or a quick certificate for sellers who dispatch products faster than others. Despite a plethora of previous studies on the role of certificates in the e-marketplace, we have a limited understanding of certificate effects in the post-order stage, where buyers can reverse their purchase decision. Based on the psychological contract violation theory and other related literature, we first explain why seller certificates can take a role in buyers' order cancellation decision. Then, we empirically examine the effects of seller certificates using the large transaction data from a leading e-marketplace in Korea. Our findings are as follows. Given the time elapsed from the order, buyers are less likely to cancel the order when the seller has a quality certificate (for sellers who have lower product return rate than others) or a quantity certificate (for experienced sellers who sold a larger amount of products than others). When the seller has a quick certificate (for sellers who dispatch products faster than others), on the other hand, buyers are more likely to cancel the order. Further, the effects of seller certificates on order cancellation are largely varying across purchase channels (Smartphone vs. PC) and product types (convenience goods, shopping goods, vs. specialty goods).",Cancellation; Certificates; E-marketplace; Psychological contract violation; Survival Analysis,Decision theory; Electronic commerce; Cancellation; Certificates; E-marketplaces; Psychological contract violations; Survival analysis; Sales,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021752345

The later is constrained by downside risk. We model the decision problems with the newsvendor model, and then analytically derive the optimal order policies of the retailer. We have analyzed several often used coordinating mechanisms under retailer downside risk constraint. We find that none of the price-only contract, returns policies contract and revenue sharing contract can coordinate a supply chain with retailer's downside risk constraint. However, by integrating the transfer payment contract with returns policy contract and the revenue sharing contract, perfect coordination is possible. For optimal decisions of the supplier, we use the numerical method to analyze the effect of the retailer downside risk on decision variables, and profits of the supplier and the retailer. Compared with the case of no risk constraints, the study has shown that the splitting of the expected channel profits between the supplier and the retailer is dependent on the retailer's risk attitude. The more risk-reverse the retailer is, the lower are the profits earned by the retailer and, of course, the more are the profits of the supplier.

Besides the quality of products and other factors such as price, the inconsistency between promised delivery lead time (PDL) and actual realized lead time could increase product returns to some extent. Thus, this paper studies the impact of product returns on the business's joint decisions of PDL and service level when both demand and returns are leadtimesensitive. Through revealing the tradeoff among the shorter PDL to capture more demand, the higher service level or the longer PDL to decrease the probability of returns due to delay and the cost in online retailing, we show that the PDL is not affected by returns when the returns sensitivity to delay is relatively low and increases with returns while the delay sensitivity increases to a threshold. In addition, the threshold decreases in the return rate to demand, which means the impact of product returns would be more serious on the business with a high return rate with respect to demand.",Online retailing; Product returns; Promised delivery lead time; Service level,Industry; Delivery lead time; Joint decisions; Online retailing; Product returns; Quality of product; Sensitivity increase; Sensitivity to delay; Service levels; Engineering,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013793194

One of the major concerns is the feasibility for product recovery, which is to meet the stringent worldwide environmental requirements. In recent years, product recovery is considered as one of the appropriate approaches for achieving efficient and effective post-use life management. However, producers have to examine and determine optimal recovery plan, which is to maximise the recovery value for a remanufactured product in order to gain significant financial and environmental sustainability. This article presents a decision disposition model to examine two types of the proposed recovery configuration selections to make the comparisons of their possible recovery utilisation value of a remanufactured product. In this study, an optimization model is developed and solved using binary programming. The results obtained for numerical application in product recovery plan showed that the proposed Type-II remanufactured product with base parts to be remanufactured is practically more desirable than the Type-I remanufactured product with base part to be de-manufactured via recycling. © 2016, International Association of Engineers.

We study how consumers' discount-seeking purchase deferrals affect online retailers' return policy choices. Lenient returns may induce higher full-price sales by limiting consumer regret, while signaling clearance unavailability risk. Contrasting earlier research that concluded a monopolist must set the refund at the clearance price when strategic consumers were overlooked, we find that an optimal refund bounded by the clearance price can mitigate purchase deferrals only when a monopolist salvages at mild discounts. To explore conditions under which a monopolist permits ""full-refund returns,"" we consider three scenarios: we permit clearing inventory without a loss; we assume lenient returns stimulate aggregate demand; we consider consumers' transaction costs. We also derive a unique rational expectations equilibrium for competing retailers, wherein each retailer's equilibrium refund is nondecreasing in its clearance price. Furthermore, retailers with clearance prices below a threshold should not allow returns, and those who do, higher clearance revenues imply higher full prices, higher quantities, and higher profits. We conclude that a credible clearance partner salvaging at higher prices than those at competing clearance mediums helps retailers gain competitive advantage when selling to strategic consumers. © 2016 INFORMS.",OM-marketing interface; Pricing and revenue management; Rational expectations; Retailing; Returns; Strategic purchase deferrals,Competition; Costs; Economics; Electronic commerce; Salvaging; Om-marketing interfaces; Rational expectations; Retailing; Returns; Revenue management; Strategic purchase deferrals; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978062460

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). Safe and acceptable topical HIV prevention methods that target the rectum are needed. Methods. MTN-017 was a phase 2, 3-period, randomized sequence, open-label, expanded safety and acceptability crossover study comparing rectally applied reduced-glycerin (RG) 1% tenofovir (TFV) and oral emtricitabine/TFV disoproxil fumarate (FTC/ TDF). In each 8-week study period participants were randomized to RG-TFV rectal gel daily, or RG-TFV rectal gel before and after receptive anal intercourse (RAI; or at least twice weekly in the event of no RAI), or daily oral FTC/TDF. Results. MSM and TGW (n = 195) were enrolled from 8 sites in the United States, Thailand, Peru, and South Africa with mean age of 31.1 years (range 18-64). There were no differences in ≥grade 2 adverse event rates between daily gel (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.09; P = .59) or RAI gel (IRR, 0.90; P = .51) compared to FTC/TDF. High adherence (≥80% of prescribed doses assessed by unused product return and Short Message System reports) was less likely in the daily gel regimen (odds ratio [OR], 0.35; P < .001), and participants reported less likelihood of future daily gel use for HIV protection compared to FTC/TDF (OR, 0.38; P < .001). Conclusions. Rectal application of RG TFV gel was safe in MSM and TGW. Adherence and product use likelihood were similar for the intermittent gel and daily oral FTC/TDF regimens, but lower for the daily gel regimen. © The Author 2017.",HIV; Microbicide; Prevention; Rectal; Tenofovir,"Adolescent; Adult; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Female; Gels; Glycerol; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Rectum; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Tenofovir; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil; glycerol; microbicide; reduced glycerin; tenofovir; unclassified drug; glycerol; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; tenofovir; adult; anal intercourse; Article; controlled study; crossover procedure; drug safety; female; gel; HIV rapid test; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; infection risk; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; men who have sex with men; outcome assessment; patient compliance; Peru; phase 2 clinical trial; phase 3 clinical trial; pre-exposure prophylaxis; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; South Africa; Thailand; transgender; United States; unspecified side effect; adolescent; clinical trial; drug effects; highly active antiretroviral therapy; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male homosexuality; middle aged; multicenter study; rectum; treatment outcome; virology; young adult",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018192380

In the forward channel of this system, the manufacturer produces the new products, the retailer is contracted to remanufacture the used ones, and then sells both the new ones and remanufactured ones to the customers. In the reverse channel, the retailer and the third party collector simultaneously collect the used products. Based on several valid assumptions, we propose a special closed-loop supply chain model with dual recycling channel within the framework of game theory, and explore how the remanufacturer should properly allocate the collection efforts to the retailer and the third party. Furthermore, we conduct performance analysis to investigate the optimal strategies for the supply chain members. Our research confirms that the remanufacturer can gain more used product returns and profits with dual recycling channel, and the optimal allocation of the collection efforts to the retailer and the third party is determined by the relationship of the reverse logistics cost coefficients. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Closed-loop supply chain; Dual recycling channel decision; Pricing; Remanufacturing; Retailer oriented,Construction equipment; Costs; Game theory; Linear matrix inequalities; Logistics; Machinery; Recycling; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Construction machinery; Construction machinery industry; Optimal allocation; Performance analysis; Recycling channels; Remanufacturing; Retailer oriented; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991310035

Liberal return policies have been widely used to attract shoppers. However, returns often increase expense and inconvenience for all parties involved: customers, retailers, and manufacturers. Despite the large fraction of purchases that are returned, there are few systematic studies to explain the underlying forces that drive return requests, and to assess the return propensity at the level of individual purchases (i.e., a particular customer purchasing a particular product), rather than in aggregate. To this end, in this paper, we provide a systematic framework for personalized predictions of return propensity. These predictions can help retailers enhance inventory management, improve customer relationships, and reduce return fraud and abuse. Specifically, we treat product returns as a result of inconsistency arising during a commercial transaction. We decompose this inconsistency into two components, one for the buying phase (e.g., product does not match description) and another for the shipping phase (e.g., product damaged during shipping). Along these lines, we introduce a generalized return propensity latent model (RPLM). We further propose a complete framework, called fused return propensity latent model (FRPLM), to jointly model the correlation among user profiles, product features, and return propensity. We present comprehensive experimental results with real-world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for assessing return propensity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Online shopping; Product return; Propensity assessment,Digital storage; Electronic commerce; Forecasting; Inventory control; Public relations; Ships; Commercial transactions; Customer relationships; Inventory management; Online shopping; Product returns; Propensity assessment; Systematic framework; Systematic study; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994047650

In order to make the remanufacturing operations more profitable, forecasting product returns is critical due to the uncertainty in quantity and timing. This paper proposes a predictive model selection algorithm to deal with the uncertainty by identifying a better predictive model. Unlike other major approaches in literature such as distributed lag models or DLMs, the predictive model selection algorithm focuses on the predictive power over new or future returns and extends the set of candidate models. The case study of reusable bottles shows that the proposed algorithm can find a better predictive model than the DLM.

Though the importance of value creation and appropriation is acknowledged, extant studies on value in product returns tend to be limited to the residual asset value (cost recovery) of the returned products. Further, value discussion in PRM is limited to the value implications for a single party in the returns transaction rather than all the product returns chain entities. The purpose of this paper is to explore value creation and appropriation in a triad of supplier-retailer-3PL in the product returns chain. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses an inductive qualitative approach. Semi-structured interviews with executives in a triad of organisations formed the primary data source for the study. Findings - The paper identifies six value drivers and develops a value creation and appropriation framework. It shows that facilitation, value orientation, process alignment and relational factors are key drivers of value creation and appropriation in PRM. Research limitations/implications - The findings reinforce the view that value creation and appropriation are the outcomes of multi-party interactions in a product return chain. The framework presented contributes to the literature by showing the linkages amongst key drivers. Practical implications - The findings show the important role of external process facilitation and how a 3PL contributes to value creation in a triadic relationship. Originality/value - Research based on a triadic product returns chain is a unique dimension of this study. © Emerald Publishing Limited.",B2B; Product returns chain; Product returns management; Qualitative triadic study; Value appropriation; Value creation,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027696014

These appealing characteristics encourage positive attitudes and subsequent purchase behavior (Homer and Kahle 1988; Kahle 1980), which is likely to be impulsive (Bhardwaj and Fairhurst 2009; Verplanken and Sato 2011). However, feelings of regret following impulse buying behavior may lead to product returns (D’Innocenzio 2011). Based on this reasoning, the following hypotheses were developed: H1: Perceived perishability is positively related to attitude toward fast fashion retailers; H2: Perceived scarcity is positively related to attitude toward fast fashion retailers; H3: Perceived low price is positively related to attitude toward fast fashion retailers; H4: Attitude toward fast fashion retailers is positively related to impulse buying behavior in fast fashion retail environments; H5: Impulse buying behavior in fast fashion retail environments is positively related to negative post-purchase emotional response; and H6: Negative post-purchase emotional response is positively related to product returning behavior in fast fashion retail environments. To test the hypotheses, a convenience sample of 303 female undergraduate students completed a questionnaire containing multi-item scales based on previous literature (e.g., Rook and Fisher 1995). Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The final model showed moderate, but acceptable, fit (χ2 (697) = 2,586.45, p =.00; CFI =.85; TLI =.84; RMSEA =.08). The paths to attitude toward fast fashion retailers from perceived perishability (γ =.14, t = 2.13, p ≤.03), perceived scarcity (γ =.16, t = 2.21, p ≤.03), and low price (γ =.05, t = 5.62, p ≤.00) were all positive and significant. Thus, H1, H2, and H3 were supported. The path between attitude and impulse buying was positive and significant (γ =.08, t = 8.50, p ≤.00), thus supporting H4. H5 was supported because the path between impulse buying at fast fashion retailers and negative post-purchase emotional response was positive and significant (γ =.04, t = 4.16, p ≤.00). The last hypothesis proposed a positive relationship between negative post-purchase emotional response and product returning behavior. The path was positive and significant (γ =.12, t = 7.30, p ≤.00). Thus, H6 was supported. The results of the current study suggest that perceptions of scarcity, perishability, and low cost do have an indirect impact on young, female consumers’ impulse buying behavior via their attitudes toward fast fashion retailers. However, because impulse buying is associated with frequent product returns (Kang and Johnson 2009), fast fashion retailers may need to restrict returns or increase prices slightly to compensate for lost profits. The moderate fit of the model suggests that other constructs have an impact on consumers’ behavior in fast fashion retail environments. These additional antecedents and consequences of fast fashion consumption behavior may offer insights to practitioners and contribute to the process of theory building. © 2016, Academy of Marketing Science.",Attitude Towards Fast Fashion Retailer; Fast Fashion Retailers; Impulse Buying; Perishability; Scarcity,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068668116

With 310 billion dollars turnover it has become one of the biggest B2C ecommerce markets in the world (WorldPay 2015). As Chinese consumers are generally leaned towards buying international brands, entering this market while exploiting the rising trend of online and mobile commerce adoption might be an interesting opportunity for western fashion companies. However, the ultimate success of an e-commerce initiative is strictly dependent on the effectiveness of the distribution process. Geographical and cultural distance, expected service level, tariff and non-tariff barriers are some of the elements making this activity more complex in a global environment. The aim of this paper is to provide a quantitative model to compare different logistic solutions underlying a B2C e-commerce initiative in China. The analysis takes the perspective of a European firm operating in the apparel industry. Research Approach: The paper has an empirical approach. It presents an Activity-based model to quantify the logistics costs of three logistics solutions that can be adopted to sell online in an international context. The alternatives have been identified through interviews and context data have been derived from case studies. The model has been eventually validated by industry experts and practitioners. The considered logistics options are (i) distribution from a warehouse located in China, (ii) distribution through a sorting hub located in China, and (iii) distribution from a warehouse in the Country of origin through express couriers. By elaborating some specific data (e.g. weight and volume of the garment) as inputs, the model returns the distributive solution associated to the lowest logistics costs. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is provided to take into account variations in both the annual demand of the item and its value. Originality: This study simultaneously addresses three major subjects which are relevant for a fashion company, i.e. the design of a logistics strategy, the use of e-commerce and the implementation of an internationalisation project. A preliminary literature review has revealed that these themes have largely been debated as stand-alone topics while the “intersection” of these fields has not been adequately investigated yet. Research Impact: The present study contributes to create knowledge in the field of technology-driven internationalisation strategies. At the same time, it paves the way to additional meaningful research that can be originated by addressing some of its limitations. For instance, one of the hints for future research on this topic is to evaluate the impact of product returns which can be complex to manage at an international level. Practical Impact: The main beneficiaries of this study are producers and/or retailers operating in the apparel industry. They can learn some of the logistics alternatives to serve the promising Chinese B2C e-commerce market and identify the most efficient strategy for them. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Apparel industry; B2C e-commerce; China; Distribution network; Internationalisation strategy; Logistics; Quantitative model,Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Electric power distribution; Electronic commerce; Logistics; Sensitivity analysis; Warehouses; Apparel industry; B2C e-commerce; China; Internationalisation; Quantitative modeling; Mobile commerce,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013158332

Microsoft's 2013 Software Vulnerability Exploitation trend report found that 73% of all vulnerabilities are exploited via ROP. The core idea of ROP is to exploit the presence of so-called gadgets, small instruction sequences ending in a return instruction. By chaining gadgets together, an attacker is able to build complex exploits. The apparent popularity of ROP is explained by its power to bypass most contemporary exploit mitigation mechanisms, such as data execution prevention (DEP) and address space layout randomization (ASLR). DEP and similar page-protection schemes prevent the execution of injected binary code, but ROP re-uses code already present in the executable memory segments, eliminating the need to inject code. ASLR randomizes the location of most libraries and executables, however, finding code segments left in a few statically known locations is often enough to leverage a ROP attack. Since the inception of ROP by Shacham [Sh07], research on ROP resembles an arms race: emerging defense techniques are continuously circumvented by increasingly subtle attacks [CW14]. In our paper [PHH15], we take a novel, statistical approach on detecting ROP programs. Modern microprocessors spend most of their circuits on machinery that optimizes the execution of programs generated by compilers from ""high-level"" languages. Among this machinery are caches, translation look-aside buffers, branch predictors, and so on. To assist programmers in detecting performance problems, a modern CPU can record several hundred different kinds of micro-architectural events that occur during program execution (e.g. mispredicted branches, L1 cache misses, etc.). These events are counted by the CPU in special registers, the so-called hardware performance counters (HPCs). In this paper, we claim and experimentally verify that the execution of a ROP program triggers such hardware events in a significantly different way than a conventional program that has been generated by a compiler. Essentially, micro-architectural events are a side channel by which a ROP program becomes distinguishable from a normal program at run time. There are several considerations that support this hypothesis: First, ROP programs use only indirect jumps (returns) to control the program flow. Common processor heuristics to detect the target of the return are useless in a ROP program because they do not follow the call/return policy. Second, ROP gadgets are small and scattered all over the code segment. Thus, there is no spatial locality in the executed code which should be observable in counters relevant to the memory subsystem. We exploit the deviant micro-architectural behavior of ROP programs by training (using existing ROP exploits and benign programs) a support vector machine (SVM) based on profiles of hardware performance counters. Note, that despite our intuition we did not short-list any HPC types for training. We receive a classifier to distinguish ROP from benign programs and use it in a monitor kernel module that tracks the evolution of the performance counters and classifies them periodically.

We quantitatively evaluate the performance impact of HadROP on benign program runs using the SPEC2006 benchmark: HadROP incurs a run time overhead of 5% on average and of 8% in the worst case.

Due to its great taste, aroma, and appearance, it is popular among Portuguese, Brazilian, Spanish, Indian, Japanese, Malaysian and Cambodian as well as Thai people. Fios de ovos is also recognized as a premium dessert. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of active packaging (AP) and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on the quality of fios de ovos during storage. It was packaged in active oxygen scavenging and modified atmosphere packaging (60% CO2/40% N2) in comparison with conventional air packaging, stored at ambient conditions. During storage, water activity, moisture content, pH, headspace gas composition, total aerobic mesophilic bacteria count, yeasts and molds count and sensory analysis in overall preference score were monitored. Those packaged in air exhibited visible mold growth after 3 days, while those in active and modified atmosphere packaging remained mold-free even after 20 days. With the overall preference criteria and trace amounts of oxygen, the observed shelf life of fios de ovos was found to be 15 days, 6 days and less than 4 days in AP, MAP and air packaging, respectively. Thus, the use of an oxygen scavenger sachet for packed fios de ovos could ensure a 2 week mold-free irrespective of initial contamination and satisfactory according to sensory evaluation and concern of the anaerobic microorganisms. The prolongation in shelf life may allow transportation of this product to a wider area, in turn, increasing market size, and improve consumer confidence, as well as minimize unsatisfied product return. In addition, shelf life extension could be longer than 2 weeks if minimization of initial microbial load has been achieved by good manufacturing practice (GMP). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Active packaging; Fios de ovos; Golden strands; Modified atmosphere packaging; Oxygen scavenger; Quality attributes,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971207150

Legally, the return of irregular migrants may be a legitimate activity by the state, but the current pressure by the European Commission on member-states to increase the current 40 percent rate of effective returns can lead them to operate returns below minimal human rights standards in a bid to increase the rate. Detailed knowledge of the impact of returns – including deportation from and to different countries – on migrants’ welfare and human rights is scarce. Based on studies on returns from EU member-states to different countries, I make three arguments. First, due to the complexity of the return process, statistics need to be unpacked better. Second, there are key conceptual problems underpinning current EU returns policy. Third, research strongly indicates that returns can render people vulnerable. In the absence of in-depth knowledge on the effects of return on migrants, I conclude with an appeal for returns to be treated with caution and their linking to the refugee crisis to be avoided. © 2016 Institute for Human Geography.",deportation; European migration policy; human rights; Irregular migration; migrant returns; refugee ‘crisis’,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062694063

Consequently, the need for the correct diagnosis of recovery/disposal options for the returned products necessitates the development of a comprehensive model that gives consideration to all general and specific parameters. Finding the best recovery strategies is based on both the product and the recovery process properties. This study therefore presents a new integrated approach, focusing on brown goods, based on a fuzzy rule-based system and fuzzy AHP to provide a correct and accurate decision-making mechanism for ranking the recovery/disposal strategies by knowledge acquisition for each particular returned product. The presented model considers the products' properties and the recovery/disposal processes' properties separately in two phases.

Theoretically, we find that the symmetric bidding equilibrium is unique unless returns are free, and when returns are free there exist multiple equilibria with different implications for sellers. Moreover, more generous return policies mitigate the winner's curse, but also push the bids higher, thus hurting bidders by eroding their surplus. In the experiment, bids increase and bidders' earnings decrease with more generous return policies as predicted. With free returns, many bidders bid above the highest possible value, subsequently returning the item regardless of value.

Demand information is censored, the exact time of stockout is not observed, and the short selling season often does not allow for replenishment. Using data for 26,749 book titles from 2007 to 2011 and a simulation experiment calibrated on real data, we show that an attribute-based choice model generates accurate demand estimates (mean absolute percentage error less than 1%) even when nearly 90% of the textbooks in the fit sample experience stockout. This performance is driven by the heterogeneity of product attributes and is robust to the occurrence of product returns. We implement this model at the bookstore in a controlled field experiment and obtain over 10% increase in profit. The results show that accounting for asymmetric and stockout-based substitution in demand estimation and inventory planning enables us to make systematic corrections in inventory mix and inventory level compared to the existing process. © 2016 INFORMS.",Demand estimation; Inventory theory and control; OM practice; Retailing; Stockout-based substitution,Industrial management; Management science; Demand estimation; Inventory theory; Om practices; Retailing; Stock-out; Textbooks,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84956860270

So, the partners of the chains seek to apply efficient coordinating strategies like discount, return, refund, buyback, or the other coordinating policies to abate the operation costs of the chains and subsequently increase market shares. Hence, because of the importance and application of these strategies in the current non-exclusive markets, in this study, we introduce different composite coordinating strategies to enhance the coordination of the supply chains. Here, we consider two competing supply chains where both chains launch the same product under different brands to the market by applying different composite coordinating strategies. Each supply chain comprises one manufacturer and a group of non-competing retailers where the manufacturer receives raw materials from an outside supplier and transforms them into a finished product; then, the products are sold to the retailers to satisfy the demands of market. In the first chain, a composite (QFF) policy, which is the combination of quantity and freight discount, as well as free shipping quantity policies, are considered between upstream and downstream members while in the second one, different composite polices are considered between upstream and downstream members such that the supplier offers a composite policy, as the first chain, to the manufacturer and the manufacturer proposes a composite (QPR) policy, which is the combination of quantity discount and partial-refund customer return policies, to the retailers. The main objective of the paper is to determine the optimal selling prices and the order quantities of the manufacturer and the retailers in each chain in presence of different composite coordinating strategies. A Stackelberg game-theoretic approach is employed between the members of each chain where the manufacturer is a follower and the retailers are leaders. The concavity of profit functions is proved. Finally, the applicability of the models is justified by presented numerical examples. Moreover, the effects of these strategies on the decisions of the chains partners are examined. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",free shipping policy; game theory; inventory; partial-refund customer returns policy; pricing; quantity discount; supply chain,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Game theory; Manufacture; Sales; Ships; Competing supply chains; Competitive markets; Customer returns policies; Finished products; Free shipping; inventory; Optimal selling price; Quantity discount; Supply chains,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961627593

The production cost structure of innovative products can be changed by collecting product returns, which can be economically valuable for enterprises. Enterprises face both production and demand randomness; hence, it is important to improve the traditional optimal production decision-making model that considers the randomness of demand only. This paper divides innovative products into structural innovation products and improved innovation products. The paper studies the optimal single-period production decision between reused parts and conventional new parts in complementary and substitute relationships. It further gives the analytical expressions for satisfying the optimal production and provides some numerical examples. The research results indicate that when producing innovative products, whether based on structural or improved innovation, with the variance of the quantity of the recycled parts increasing, the optimal purchase quantity of the conventional parts will increase but the expected profits for the innovative products will decrease. With integrated substitution and complementation based on improved innovation, enhancing the fluctuation in the number of recycled parts has a greater impact on the optimal purchase quantity of the substitute conventional parts than that of the complementary parts. © 2016 Yi Su et al.",,Decision making; Random processes; Recycling; Analytical expressions; Complementation; Demand randomness; Expected profits; Innovative product; Optimal production; Production decisions; Research results; Innovation,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994234768

The supplier-buyer setup is described in terms of textile manufacturer-retailer supply chain where quality inspection is an important aspect and the product return from the customer is generally accepted. Textile manufacturer produces the product, whereas, retailer acts as a reseller who buys the products from the textile manufacturer and sells them to the customers. In this context, the former invests in the product quality whereas the latter invests in the random quality inspection and traceability. The relationships between the textile manufacturer and the retailer are recognized as horizontal and vertical alliances and modeled using non-cooperative and cooperative games.

Almost all existing techniques evaluate resource use based on their burden relative to value, while the central point of Circular Economy is to create value through material retention. The existing burden-orientated techniques are therefore unsuitable for guiding managers in relation to Circular Economy objectives. This paper presents a new performance metric, the longevity indicator, which measures contribution to material retention based on the amount of time a resource is kept in use. The measure is composed of three generic components: initial lifetime, earned refurbished lifetime and earned recycled lifetime. Management of these components can be used for decision making and performance assessment in the Circular Economy. The example of precious metals in mobile phone handsets is used to illustrate the general application and suitability of this indicator. Findings show that for materials to be retained, managers should encourage longer lifetime use, increase product return levels for initial use and refurbished phones, and select the most effective recycling processes available. This paper advances performance indicators for Circular Economy, and provides a tool which can be applied at managerial and organizational levels to measure the impact of business decisions on the longevity of precious materials. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Circular economy; Longevity; Managerial indicator; Mobile phone,Cellular telephones; Managers; Mobile phones; Recycling; Restoration; Telephone sets; Circular economy; Environmental assessment; General applications; Longevity; Mobile phone handsets; Organizational levels; Performance assessment; Performance indicators; Decision making,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988813602

This study examines the impact of OCRs characteristics (valence, volume, and variance) on return decisions with a rich multi-year dataset from a major online retailer covering the electronics and furniture category. The main finding is that overly positive review valence (i.e., higher than the long-term product average), induces more purchases, but also more returns. An explanation for these findings is that OCRs help to form product expectations at the moment of purchase. Therefore, the purchase probability increases but the high expectations due to overly positive reviews may not be met, which results in negative expectation disconfirmation and consequently increases return probability as well. The effect of review valence on returns is stronger for novice buyers and for cheaper products. We further find that review volume and variance mainly affect purchase decisions, and have little to no effect on product returns. This study thus demonstrates that products returns should be considered when examining OCR effects, especially because overly positive reviews may hinder a retailer's financial performance, due to large reverse logistics costs associated with product returns. © 2016 New York University",e-Commerce; e-WOM; Online customer reviews; Product returns,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964335798

No-clean flux performs well and can save steps in manufacturing. If used properly, no-clean flux can be effective, safe and reliable. It is a common misconception that since it is no-clean flux it can be used in any manner and still be safe and reliable. Numerous examples can be shown where no-clean flux, when used improperly, can lead to electrochemical migration and dendritic growth, leading to electrical fails. With this in mind, the question becomes, what is the proper use of no-clean flux? The focus of this paper is to share the conditions in which no-clean flux becomes benign. This paper will present the conditions of no-clean flux residues (from any of the flux and paste suppliers) that cause poor electrical performance and explain what leads to the poor performance. Millions of electronic systems assembled with no-clean flux perform very well in the field. However under some conditions, whether the product has seen early or extended time in the field, it fails to function. Additionally there are cases where causes a battery fails to hold a charge, no matter how many new, good, replacement batteries are installed. The electronics industry is seeing a greater number of product recalls, product returns with no defects found, and hard short failures due to electrochemical migration than the industry experienced with hardware from the '70-'90s. Many of the field failures seen today are not due to software, bad components or abuse of the hardware, but are due to a variety of conditions relating to the use of no-clean flux. These include: shorting dendrites growing under conformal coating/potting compounds; parasitic leakage issues under low standoff components, such as QFNs or Power FETs; dendrite shorting of SMT components and vias near selective solder regions on printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs). If the board and components are ionically clean, what is causing the leakage and electrochemical migration creating the hard short under/over and around the parts that only saw flux? This paper will explain what can be done on the production floor to ensure that the residues are benign and will remain so. It will also address typical areas to which no-clean flux residues can travel or are trapped and need additional thermal attention and monitoring. © 2016 SMTA.",Fails; Flux; No-clean; Process; ROSE; SIR,Electric batteries; Electronics industry; Fluxes; Hardware; Lead-free solders; Manufacture; Microelectronics; Printed circuit boards; Printed circuits; Processing; Reconfigurable hardware; Soldering alloys; Conformal coatings; Electrical performance; Electrochemical migration; Electronic systems; Fails; Parasitic leakages; Printed circuit board assembly; ROSE; Electronic equipment manufacture,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964961787

In order to meet environmental requirements, firms carry out collection activities and provide incentive offers to attract product returns. A mixed integer non-linear programming model for a Closed-Loop Supply Chain including decisions for collection activities, incentive offers and recovery options is formulated and validated. Quantity is modeled as a function of incentive offers and distance between the collection centers (distribution/retail centers) and consumers. The quality of product returns follows an arbitrary probability distribution, which is shifted by incentive level. Quality of product returns dictates the possible recovery options, which these can undergo. The model is subjected to scenario analysis. This is comprised of conditions wherein rebate, or discount incentives is preferred and when low or high incentive levels are favored. High stockout cost to secondary consumers encouraged the model to perform more cash rebate activities to stimulate more product returns to satisfy secondary consumer demand. In another situation, high cost of activities while having high stockout cost to secondary consumers induced the model to carryout discount activities as this would generate sales rather than the cash rebate which simply incentivizes the participation in the takeback program.

It becomes further complicated in the realm of Big Data where related information is spread over different data repositories. However, data mining techniques are usually applied on a single flat table. This work focuses on generating a mining table by aggregating information from multiple local tables and external data sources and automatically generating potentially discriminant features. It extends data aggregation techniques by navigating paths where a single table is traversed multiple times. Such paths are not considered by existing techniques, which results in the loss of several attributes. Our framework also prevents leakage of the class information by avoiding features built after the knowledge of the class label. Experiments are performed on transactional data of a U.S. consumer electronics retailer to predict causes of product returns. In addition, we augmented the dataset with Suppliers information and Reviews to show the value of data integration. The results show that our technique improves classification accuracy and generates discriminant features that mitigate the impact of class imbalance. © 2016 IEEE.",Class imbalance; Classification; Data integration; Feature construction,Classification (of information); Data integration; Data mining; Class imbalance; Classification accuracy; External data sources; Feature construction; Feature generation; Imbalanced Learning; Relational Database; Transactional data; Big data,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015193815

However, the profitability of take-back systems is hampered by several factors, including the lack of information on the quantity and timing of to-be-returned used products to a remanufacturing facility. Factors that contribute to this unpredictability in the waste stream include product design features, consumers' awareness of recycling opportunities, sociodemographic characteristics, peer pressure, and the tendency of consumers to keep used items in storage. A system that helps predict when the consumer will stop using a product and store, resell, recycle, or discard it could help manufacturers better estimate return trends. The objective of this paper is to develop an agent-based simulation (ABS) framework that integrates a discrete choice analysis (DCA) technique to predict consumer end-of-use (EOU) decisions. The proposed simulation tools examine the impact of design features, interaction among individual consumers, and sociodemographic criteria related to the number of e-product returns. A numerical example of a cellphone take-back system has been provided to show the application of the model.

Refurbishing to remarket or to fulfill warranty claims are the two common disposition options considered to unlock the value in consumer returns, which present the OEM with a challenging problem: How should an OEM dynamically allocate consumer returns between fulfilling warranty claims and remarketing refurbished products over the product's life cycle? We analyze this dynamic allocation problem and find that when warranty claims and consumer returns are jointly taken into account, the remarketing option is generally dominated by the option of refurbishing and earmarking consumer returns to fulfill warranty claims. Over the product's life cycle, the OEM should strategically emphasize earmarking of consumer returns at the early stages of the life cycle to build up earmarked inventory for the future warranty demand, whereas it should consider remarketing at the later stages of the life cycle after enough earmarked inventory is accumulated or most of the warranty demand uncertainty is resolved. These findings show that, for product categories with significant warranty coverage and refund costs, remarketing may not be the most profitable disposition option even if the product has strong remarketing potential and the OEM has the pricing leverage to tap into this market. We also show that the optimal dynamic disposition policy is a price-dependent base-stock policy where the earmarked quantity is capacitated by the new and refurbished product sales quantities. We compare with the myopic policy and show that it is a good heuristic for the optimal dynamic disposition policy. © 2016 INFORMS.",Closed-loop supply chains; Consumer electronics; Consumer returns; Refurbishing; Warranty,Consumer electronics; Costs; Optimization; Restoration; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Consumer returns; Demand uncertainty; Dynamic allocations; Original equipment manufacturers; Product categories; Refurbishing; Warranty; Life cycle,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990978840

A strategy that involves the purchase of relief supplies immediately after a disaster (instant purchasing) can reduce operational cost. However, purchasing price and possible supply scarcity are high because of the time urgency. Alternatively, pre-purchasing relief supplies is a strategy that is characterized by a low purchase price. However, this approach entails a loss associated with the uncertainty of demand and an increase in inventory cost. To resolve this problem, we introduce a supply chain methodology into humanitarian operations management by considering the system as a relief supply chain. We determine that pre-purchasing relief supplies from a supplier with an option contract is superior to both pre-purchasing with a buyback contract and instant-purchasing with a return policy. An option contract enables the coordination of a relief supply chain and the achievement of Pareto improvement. Additionally, with consideration of the risk level and preference, profit distribution with an option contract becomes acceptable for both the supplier and the purchaser. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One major challenge is correctly forecasting the date when used products will return, how many used products will return, and in which condition the returned products will be. Based on a review of current literature, this paper aims to identify gaps in academic research regarding the modeling of product returns for remanufacturing. It will focus on quantitative models, in which the quantity of returned products is either a decision variable (DV) or directly depends on other decision variables, such acquisition prices, i.e., the quantity of products returned can be influenced by decision makers. Subsequently, we will propose a new approach to incorporate consumers into Closed Loop Supply Chains (CLSC), in order to more precisely forecast product returns. The proposed voucher system, a time-dependent buy-back-offer on the part of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), is designed to influence consumers’ return behavior. Finally, using game theory for quantitative modeling, this approach will permit a closer examination of the problems regarding dynamic production planning with remanufacturing options. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Consumer Surplus; Decision Variable; Production Planning; Reverse Logistics; Supply Chain,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988233264

In the design of reverse logistic system, recovery options are embedded in traditional supply chain for treating returned products. The recovery system includes collection centres, remanufacturing plants and disposal centres. Since the product return is supply driven, there is an uncertainty about it. In the proposed configuration for closed loop supply chain, the optimised configuration for supply chain in terms of locating recovery plants is developed. Accordingly, a fuzzy mixed integer linear programming model develops to deal with the uncertainty of returning products by customers. A general-purpose solver (LINGO 8.0) and a Meta heuristic approach (genetics algorithm) are implemented to solve the proposed model. The answers are compared by defining indexes and then the optimal answer, configuration and variables are identified.

Product returns provide a significant expense to businesses, with some studies showing that product returns cost US manufacturers and retailers an estimated S100 billion annually, reducing profits by around 3.8 percent on average per retailer or manufacturer (Blanchard, 2007). And, this cost is only likely to rise as retailers increasingly engage in multi-channel strategies. The increasing flexibility of retailers to allow customers to shop and purchase both online and offline has offered numerous benefits to consumers such as increases in value and convenience. However, it has also impacted customer product return behavior. Product returns are potentially more costly in this environment as customers cannot ‘touch and feel’ the product before purchase online and purchases online are often returned to the retail store (Ofek, Katona, and Sarvary, 2011). This is likely to decrease profit for the retailer through both increases in product returns and increases in product return management costs. © V.

In order to make the remanufacturing operations more profitable, forecasting product returns is critical with regards to the uncertainty in quantity and timing. This paper proposes a predictive model selection algorithm to deal with the uncertainty by identifying better predictive models. Unlike other major approaches in literature (distributed lag model or DLM), the predictive model selection algorithm focuses on the predictive power over new or future returns. The proposed algorithm extends the set of candidate models that should be considered: autoregressive integrated moving average or ARIMA (previous returns for future returns), DLM (previous sales for future returns), and mixed model (both previous sales and returns for future returns). The prediction performance measure from holdout samples is used to find a better model among them. The case study of reusable bottles shows that one of the candidate models, ARIMA, can predict better than the DLM depending on the relationships between returns and sales. The univariate model is widely unexplored due to the criticism that the model cannot utilize the previous sales. Another candidate model, mixed model, can provide a chance to find a better predictive model by combining the ARIMA and DLM. The case study also shows that the DLM in the predictive model selection algorithm can provide a good predictive performance when there are relatively strong and static relationships between returns and sales.

Findings – The findings indicate that consumers perceived knowledge gain via customization process influences the utilitarian value, which directly impacts levels of likelihood of product return and price sensitivity. The process value, on the hedonic side, influences more on the endowment addition. Endowment addition is found to mediate the relationship between the hedonic benefits and the two utilitarian outcome variables: price sensitivity and likelihood of product return. Originality/value – Understanding the consequences of customization is particularly crucial for marketers. This research is the first to expand and further our knowledge of customization, particularly in relation to its outcomes of customers’ behavioral intentions. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",E-retailing; Endowment addition; Expected likelihood of product return; Online mass customization; Price sensitivity; Product information framing,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84932184683

The retailer’s conservative attitude to order results in poor performance of the supplier and the whole supply chain. A new contract which combines put options and selective return policies is developed. The retailer buys option contracts when he places an order, then decides to exercise part or all of them after the sales season so that he can choose the return quantity selectively. The exercise price is equivalent to the wholesale price of merchandise. The result demonstrates that this contract can coordinate the supply chain well and be carried out normally despite the retailer’s risk preference being private because the supplier’s pricing policy is independent of retailer’s risk aversion. The numerical analysis shows that the retailer’s expected utility outperforms that of the expected utility under the classical buyback contract. © 2015, Vienna University of Technology.

The total value of these returns is estimated at about $100 billion a year in the USA. In order to reduce their negative impacts on the environment and prevent high disposal costs, these returned products need to be properly handled, processed, and, if applicable, remanufactured, recycled, or reused. However, since the primary focus of most manufacturers is the forward supply chain, a large proportion of the returned products’ value is lost. Two key decision policies affecting the performance of such systems are the target quality for components used in the primary product and duration of the time returned products are accumulated before they are remanufactured. High targeted quality increases the production cost but cuts on product return rate. Long accumulation time, on the other hand, increases production lot sizes for remanufacturing that results lower remanufacturing costs per unit product. When there is a market for remanufactured products the tradeoff between profit from selling primary products and that of remanufactured units may justify targeting a lower than perfect quality and still maximize the total profit. And this could be achieved without negative effects on environment. In this work, a model for a forward/reverse supply chain is developed to satisfy a fixed demand with a combination of new and remanufactured products. The objective is to maximize the total profit as a function of two above decision factors. The application of the proposed model has been demonstrated by several numerical examples. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.",Optimization; Remanufacturing; Returned products; Reverse supply chain; Sustainability,Chains; Costs; Manufacture; Optimization; Profitability; Sustainable development; Accumulation time; Decision factors; Primary products; Production lot size; Remanufactured products; Remanufacturing; Returned products; Reverse supply chains; Supply chains,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939968430

One way firms mitigate return tendency is to employ post-purchase techniques such as surveys, follow-up calls, and price return guarantee, which are costly to the company. By controlling for or reducing product return behavior, companies can increase overall profits and shareholder value. This paper examines the role of mental simulation on reducing post-purchase information search tendency, which contributes to post-purchase cognitive dissonance. It is argued that consumers primed with process simulation (i.e., thinking about the use of the product) will search for less information than those primed with outcome simulation (i.e., thinking about the benefits of using the product). Consumers who search for less information are less likely to experience greater levels of post-purchase dissonance. This behavior is posited to depend upon whether the consumption of the product purchased is made in the near future or the distant future. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.",Cognitive Dissonance; Great Level; Information Search; Process Simulation; Reverse Logistics,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125101370

This study examines two questions: (1) how do undesirable system responses affect people physiologically, and (2) to what extent can we predict physiological changes from the speech signal alone? To address these questions, we use a new corpus of simultaneous speech and high-quality physiological recordings in the product returns domain (the SRI BioFrustration Corpus). ""Triggers"" were used to frustrate users at specific times during the interaction to produce emotional responses at similar times during the experiment across participants. For each of eight return tasks per participant, we compared speaker-normalized pre-trigger (cooperative system behavior) regions to posttrigger (uncooperative system behavior) regions. Results using random forest classifiers show that changes in spectral and temporal features of speech can predict heart rate changes with an accuracy of ~70%.

The nature of such decisions is complex due to the uncertainty existing in the quality of the product returns and lack of information about the product. Consequently, the need of correct diagnosis of recovery/ disposal options for the returned products necessitates the development of a comprehensive model considering all technical and non-technical parameters. Although human experts with the aid of practical experience may handle such complex problems, this procedure is time consuming and may lead to imprecise decisions. This study presents a fuzzy rule-based system to provide a correct decision mechanism for ranking the recovery/disposal strategies by knowledge acquisition through a simple reverse supply chain with a collection center for each particular returned product. The proposed system has applications with a focus on brown goods, although the system may be applied to other similar kinds of products through some changes.

Consequently, increasing attention has been paid to production and inventory management of the product recovery system where demand is satisfied through either manufacturing brand-new products or remanufacturing returned products into new ones. In this work, we investigate a recovery system with two product types and two return flows. A periodic-review inventory problem is addressed in the two-product recovery system and an approximate dynamic programming approach is proposed to obtain production and recovery decisions. A single-period problem is first solved and the optimal solution is characterized by a multilevel threshold policy. For the multi-period problem, we show that the threshold levels of each period are solely dependent on the gradients of the cost-to-go function at points of interest after approximation. The gradients are estimated by an infinitesimal perturbation analysis-based method and a backward induction approach is then applied to derive the threshold levels of each period.

Consumers face an uncertain valuation before purchase, and the realization of that purchase's value occurs only after the return deadline has passed. Depending on the product lifecycle length and magnitude of return rate, a retailer decides on strategies for that product's return deadline, including return prohibition, life-cycle return, and fixed return deadline. In addition, the influence of the return deadline on consumers' behavior and the pricing and inventory policies of the retailer are systematically investigated. Moreover, based on the analysis of consumer return behavior on a traditional buy-back contract, we present a new differentiated buy-back contract, contingent on return deadline, to coordinate a supply chain consisting of an upstream manufacturer and a downstream retailer. Finally, extensions on some specific behavioral factors such as moral hazard, inertia return, and external effect are investigated. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Because of the need for timely information regarding their quality, a common business practice is to establish procedures for the classification of used products (returns), which is not always error-free. The existence of a multitude of sites where used products can be collected, further increases the complexity of reverse supply chain design and management. In this paper we formulate the objective function for a reverse supply chain with multiple collection sites and the possibility of returns sorting, assuming general distributions of demand and returns quality in a single-period context. We derive conditions for the determination of the optimal acquisition and remanufacturing lot-sizing decisions under alternative locations of the unreliable classification/sorting operation. We provide closed-form expressions for the selection of the optimal sorting location in the special case of identical collection sites and guidelines for tackling the decision-making problem in the general case. Furthermore, we examine analytically the effect of the cost and accuracy of the classification procedure on the profitability of the alternative supply chain configurations. Our analysis, which is accompanied by a brief numerical investigation, offers insights regarding the impact of yield variability, number of collection sites, and location and characteristics of the returns classification operation both on the acquisition decisions and on the profitability of the reverse supply chain. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) with in the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

In recent decades, many companies in developed countries have begun searching in this subject and taking it into account as one of the main processes in their supply chain management. Reverse logistics gain increased attention globally for economic and environmental reasons and it has caused to existence of new global competition between organizations. Reverse logistics include all operations that are related to the product returns such as: collection and inspection, material classification, processes related to returns, reuse and extension of useful lifecycle for used products. Nowadays, making connection and information transaction with suppliers, manufacturers and customers without information technology supporting, is not possible; according this, implementing information technology and e-commerce play an essential role in the chain. E-commerce focused on sharing business information, operating business negotiations, maintaining business relationships, settling and executing agreements by means of telecommunication networks, often the Internet, in order to achieve business transactions.

We demonstrate when and why the retailer may benefit from refusing consumer returns, even though offering consumer returns allows the supply chain to implement the expostmarket segmentation. Granting the retailer the right to refuse consumer returns may sometimes improve supply chain efficiency: it eliminates the manufacturer's attempt to induce inefficient consumer returns and bring the equilibrium back to that in the vertically integrated benchmark. We also find that the refund and the retail price can move in the opposite directions when product reliability varies, and consumer returns have a nontrivial impact on the quality choice. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",channel returns; consumer returns; supply chain management,Supply chain management; Channel returns; Consumer returns; Consumer valuations; Naval research; Product reliability; Quality choice; Supply chain efficiency; Uncertainty problems; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954391921

The total value of commercial returns, which is defined as products returned by customers for any reasons within a specified warranty period, is estimated at about 100 billion a year in the United States. Therefore, these returns need to be remanufactured, recycled, and reused in order to utilize their value and reduce the environmental impact and disposal costs. In this research, various aspects influencing the efficiency of the remanufacturing activities have been studied with the main objective of maximizing the net profit for the manufacturer. Two key decision policies affecting the performance of such systems are the target quality for components used in the primary product and duration of the time returned products are accumulated before they are remanufactured. The major contribution of this research is the incorporation of a customer quality tolerance function to estimate product return rate. Since with a given level of product deficiency some customers may decide to return a product while others would be happy to keep it, inclusion this function reflects a more realistic approach for estimation of the return rate. The application of the proposed model has been demonstrated by several numerical examples. © 2015 IEEE.",commercial returns; customer quality tolerance; remanufacturing,Environmental impact; Manufacture; commercial returns; Customer quality; Decision policy; Primary products; Product returns; remanufacturing; Tolerance function; Warranty period; Sales,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931050722

However, management research has neglected to examine ways of reducing return rates without causing a concomitant decrease in sales. Drawing from signalling and dissonance theories, we investigate the relationship between online retailers' reputation and product return rates. Two experiments designed to produce causal conclusions show that reputation reduces return rates (Studies 1 and 2) and that return motivation is a boundary condition for that relationship (Study 2). A field study based on an online consumer panel demonstrates the robustness of the negative impact of online retailer reputation on product returns in a setting that emphasizes external validity (Study 3), in comparison with Studies 1 and 2, which maximize internal validity. Study 3 also examines managerially important contingencies of the causal relationship by considering three variables: purchase frequency; retailer type; and customer gender. Overall findings indicate that an online retailer's reputation is a powerful means of reducing product return rates. The findings also show that the strength of the relationship between reputation and product returns is influenced by return motivation and the three variables investigated in the field study. © 2016 British Academy of Management.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84956794364

A multichannel retailing strategy is becoming popular as it can enhance consumers’ shopping experience by offering consumers the options of searching for product information, buying products, and returning products either offline or online. However, a multichannel retailing strategy does not necessarily imply the integration of all steps in the shopping process. One interesting difference across multichannel retailers is how the return process is handled. Previous research has shown that some return policies may affect purchase intentions. There is no research to date that specifically investigates the effect of the nature of the multichannel return policy on online purchase intentions. However, since a generous return policy increases costs, it is important to investigate to what extent it may also increase revenues by increasing purchase rates. Such knowledge could help multichannel retailers to better design and manage their return policy. The objective of this paper is to propose a study of the influence of offering a multichannel return policy on online purchase intentions. Additionally, we propose the investigation of the roles of the three potential moderators: level of online purchasing experience (extensive vs. limited), product type (search vs. experience), and brand familiarity. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.",,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979881734

Design/methodology/approach – This paper mainly uses the game theory technique to analyze the problem. The manufacturer and the retailer are vertically integrated in the traditional channel, and the results of the centralized dual-channel supply chain are obtained. Then, the Stackelberg game was adopted to analyze the decentralized dual-channel supply chain. Finally, the detailed numerical simulation is proposed to obtain straight-forward insights for the industrial managers. Findings – The mathematic analysis used shows that the main findings of this paper are: in the centralized scenario, the retailer and the manufacturer will charge higher selling prices when they offer return policy, and the demand for each channel increases, which results in higher profit; and the price and refund price of the direct channel in the centralized and decentralized dual-channel are the same, respectively. Originality/value – Most previous literatures highlight that return policy plays an important role in supply chain which considering one channel. But there is no study on the customer return policy in dual-channel supply chain. This paper is a further step to model the effects of customer returns policy on the pricing policy and optimize the profits in a dual-channel supply chain.

We propose and examine a failure-recovery mechanism (i.e., contractual stockout recovery) in the presence of demand uncertainty and compare it with failureprevention mechanisms in a dyadic distribution channel. We find that stockout recovery mechanisms can improve channel profitability under certain conditions. More importantly, we find that stockout recovery may outperform stockout prevention mechanisms such as return policy and vendor managed inventory in improving manufacturer and channel profitability. This is because stockout recovery reduces channel-wide stockout risks and allows benefits from the reduced risks to be shared between the manufacturer and the retailer, helping alleviate double marginalization. Although return policy also reduces stockout risks, it does so by increasing inventory risks in the channel without reducing channel exposure to demand uncertainty. Thus, our research suggests that stockout recovery can be an effective alternative in managing stockouts to those common methods of stockout prevention mechanisms. © 2015 INFORMS.",Distribution channel governance; Service failure prevention and recovery; Stockouts,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941957127

This study provides insight into the role of governance structures in interfirm cooperation and their effects on biotechnological product innovation and company success. Most of the existing literature regarding alliances and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) examines their effects on technology recipients' innovation performance. Here, the effects of alliances and M&A on both the innovation success and financial performance of technology suppliers (i.e., sources) are examined. Drawing from a sample of 220 human therapeutic biotechnology and biopharmaceutical firms over a period of 32 years (1980-2011), an analysis of the effects of biotechnology clusters, strategic alliances, and acquisitions is provided. This study reveals the existence of a risk-return trade-off for strategic alliances between biotech companies and larger, more established firms. Increased biotech company involvement in product development alliances decreases risk by increasing the likelihood of future product introductions. The trade-off, however, is that biotech companies earn lower returns when their products are developed through such alliances. A similar risk-return trade-off effect is found for clusters. However, acquisitions generally affect both product introductions and product returns in a negative way. These findings have strategic implications not only for managing the development of biotechnological product innovations and technology platforms but also for commercialization strategies with respect to interfirm cooperation and risk reduction. © 2014 Product Development & Management Association.",,Biotechnology; Economic and social effects; Innovation; Product development; Technology transfer; Biopharmaceutical firms; Biotechnology clusters; Financial performance; Governance structures; Innovation performance; Pharmaceutical innovations; Product introduction; Technology platforms; Mergers and acquisitions,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027937748

In case of style/fashion goods, demand forecasting is extremely difficult due to short selling cycles. The purpose of this study was to minimise the cost of excess stocking without compromising product availability. To achieve these conflicting objectives, our study includes two ordering instances and two returns policies. The time between orders subsequently helps resolve demand uncertainty. Existing studies consider only one type of returns policy, that is, returns on the entire purchase quantity; whereas our study considers two types of returns policies: returns on the first order size and returns on the entire purchase quantity. This study also includes models for the retailer and the supply chain system. Analytical and numerical insights into our study enable the retailer to select his appropriate returns policies to maximise his as well as systems expected profits.

The OEM makes procurement and production decisions and the retailer makes ordering decisions based on their own cost/incentive structures. The two parties in the supply chain use either a push or a pull contract to trade with each other. We consider both shortand long-manufacturing lead times. We develop models to obtain their optimal policies for different scenarios depending on the contract type and the information the OEM has about the random yield rate. We compare the results of different scenarios and develop managerial insights. We also carry out numerical analysis and evaluate the supply chain performance.

Accurate forecasting of used product returns can assist in effectively managing the sourcing activities for cores. The application of existing forecasting models to actual data provided by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) remanufacturer resulted in the following challenges: (i) inherent difficulties in estimation due to long return lags in the data and (ii) required adjustments for initial conditions. This article develops methods to address these issues and illustrates the proposed approach using the data provided by the OEM remanufacturer. The cost implications of using the proposed method to source cores are also investigated. Results of the performed analysis showed that the proposed forecasting approach performed best when the product is in the maturity or decline stages of its life cycle, with the rate of product returns balanced with the demand volume for the remanufactured product. Forecasting product returns can therefore be best leveraged for reducing the acquisition costs of cores in such settings.

Growing environmental and social concerns are driving firms to incorporate sustainable strategies into designing of their reverse supply chain (RSC) network. A sustainable RSC can be attained by following the triple bottom line (TBL) philosophy i.e. economical, social and environmental development. In this paper, we develop a sustainable reverse logistics model for laptop manufacturers for handling of end-of-life (EOL) and end-of-use (EOU) product returns. In the first stage of the model, a hybrid method using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) based on the criteria of TBL is applied to calculate weights for the three dimensions of sustainability. In the second stage, a three objective mixed integer linear programming model is developed in fuzzy environment which minimises the total cost, the environmental impact (in terms of CO2e emissions) and maximises the social impact of the network utilising the weights of the objectives from the first stage. The social sustainability is tacked in the model by the management of social resources including training for the workers, fixed jobs as well as inclusion of variable jobs based on the quantity of returns. The model is validated through a case study and its societal, economical and environmental impact is discussed. © 2015 IEEE.",AHP; Fuzzy multi objective optimization; reverse logistics; TOPSIS; Triple Bottom Line,Competition; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Fuzzy neural networks; Hierarchical systems; Human resource management; Integer programming; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Supply chains; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Mixed integer linear programming model; Reverse logistics; Reverse logistics network; Social and environmental; Sustainable strategies; TOPSIS; Triple Bottom Line; Sustainable development,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931046837

Even when they do include this metric, increases in product return behavior are usually considered merely an economic cost that must be managed by decreasing the marketing resource allocations toward the customers making the returns. However, recent research has suggested that satisfactory product return experiences can actually benefit firms by lowering the customer's perceived risk of current and future purchases. To better understand the role of this perceived risk in the firm-customer exchange process, the authors conduct a large-scale customer selection and optimal resource allocation field experiment with 26,000 customers from an online retailer over six months. They find that the firm is able to increase both its short-and long-term profits when accounting for the perceived risk related to product returns in addition to managing product return costs. Furthermore, the authors find that by including this risk, rather than simply implementing traditional customer lifetime value-based models generically, the firm can target more profitable customers. © 2015, American Marketing Association.",Customer lifetime value; Customer perceived risk; Field experiment; Optimal resource allocation; Product returns,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930511150

Customers that experience dissonance may seek to reverse the effects of their purchase decision by returning the product (Gilovich and Medvec 1995; Zeelenberg et al. 1996). Cognitive dissonance may have an immediate influence on product returns, however, it is also important to consider antecedents that may affect the level of that cognitive dissonance (Inman and Zeelenberg 2002; Solvang 2007). In the research presented in this paper the relationship between the awareness of return policies, customer opportunism, and switching barriers on two forms of cognitive dissonance (product and emotional) is reported. In addition, the moderating role of gender on these relationships is identified. Structural equation models were tested for the sample in total and used to assess the role that gender has as a moderator. The role that cognitive dissonance plays in product returns is based on a post purchase comparison of what was purchased versus other alternatives that were available. Cognitive dissonance is reported in the literature to consist of two dimensions, product dissonance and emotional dissonance. Product dissonance represents an aspect of dissonance related to the product purchased that in turn results in emotional dissonance that is closely tied to, but separate from product dissonance (Sweeney et al. 2000). Customer awareness of return policies represents the level of customer awareness of the return policies that the retailer has put in place. Customer opportunism is based on the notion of an individual or organization acting in its own self-interest (Williamson 1975). The present research suggests that the same concept may apply to retail consumers where they may act in their own self interests if given the chance (Harris 2010). Switching barriers are related to the cost and effort to the customer of switching products or switching retailers. This is important to consider as customers experiencing cognitive dissonance may search for information and find other retailers or substitute products (Gbadamosi 2009). A bootstrapping procedure was used to determine the significance of the path coefficient by evaluating 5,000 random samples of 308 Target and Wal-Mart customers who had made product returns. H1.1 was supported, indicating a negative relationship between customer awareness and emotional dissonance. H1.2 was supported indicating a negative relationship between customer awareness and product dissonance. H2.1 was supported showing a positive linkage between customer opportunism and emotional dissonance. H2.2 was supported with a positive linkage between customer opportunism and product dissonance. H3.1 was supported where switching barriers was positively associated with the emotional dissonance. H3.2 was also supported with switching barriers positively associated with product dissonance. H4.0 was supported indicating a positive association between product dissonance and emotional dissonance. The model was also evaluated by comparing subgroups for male and female customers separately along with the bootstrapping procedure. Group comparisons were made using a parametric t-test to detect significant differences between the path coefficients for each subgroup (Henseler et al. 2009; Keil et al. 2000). By examining the path coefficients for the male subgroup the previous hypotheses were supported with the only exception being H3.2. For females, when the direct effects of the path coefficients were considered, only one of the hypothesized linkages (H3.1) was not supported. Using the Keil et al. (2000) method parametric t-tests were calculated for the difference between the direct effects of the path coefficients for male and female subgroups. These results showed a significant difference between customer awareness and the two dimensions of cognitive dissonance (H1.1 and H1.2). Since the path coefficient is negative these linkages were less for male customers than they were for female customers. Based on the significant differences between the subgroups, the direct effects for H4.0 were significantly stronger for male customers, indicating they were more likely to have product dissonance impact emotional dissonance. The research reported here has addressed the product and emotional dimensions of cognitive dissonance related to returns.

Economic viability is a key ingredient for environmentally sustainable behavior and policies, and our decision making framework includes producers, refurbishers and recyclers. We model the lifecycle of a consumer electronics product to examine the complex interactions among different participants and their decisions. Using data from recyclers and marketing and supply chain literature, we find that i) sustainable CLSC policies require a well-calibrated return rate among types of products (new and refurbished) and consumers (innovators and imitators); ii) a sustainable return policy increases sales significantly for both types of customers; and iii) product design that improves refurbishability, and marketing efforts that create perceived differentiation between products and at the same time social awareness and acceptability for refurbished products, is critical for economic sustainability of refurbishers and recyclers. Our model can be used at a company or industry level to conduct cost-benefit scenarios for all participants of the CLSC, and make decisions based on systemic value. It can also be used to create public policies and incentives to reward companies that meet these benchmarks, for sustained economic and environmental benefits. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Closed-loop supply chain; Economic sustainability; End of life returns; Environmental sustainability; Product design; System dynamics,Commerce; Consumer electronics; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Life cycle; Marketing; Product design; Restoration; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Economic sustainability; End of lives; Environmental sustainability; System Dynamics; Sustainable development,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930943062

The computational results, obtained on a recent set of benchmark problems with 6480 instances, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic methods from the literature, and that it achieved an average optimality gap equal to 0.283% within average 8.3 s.

Materials and Methods: Percent live weight, Percent carcass weight, Texture, color, and microbiological analysis was done for edible byproducts viz. liver, heart, kidney, spleen, brain and testicle and longissimus dorsi muscle was taken as a reference. Results: The edible byproducts of Barbari kids constitute about 3% of the live weight of an animal of which liver contributed maximum (1.47%) followed by testicles (0.69%) and heart (0.41%). While the same constituted 3.57, 1.70, and 0.99%, respectively on carcass weight. There was significant (p<0.05) difference among all organs regarding textural properties. Liver required the maximum shear force and work of shear (121.48N and 32.19 kg-sec) followed by spleen and heart. All organs revealed characteristics color values (L*, a*, b*, chroma, and hue) which were significantly different (p<0.05) from muscle values. The total viable count, coliform count showed slight differences for all organs studied. The staphylococcus counts were low with little differences among organs. Conclusion: Edible byproducts have a significant contribution to carcass weight which could enhance total edible portion of the carcass. Efficient utilization of these by-products returns good source of revenue to the meat industries. Textural and color analysis give information for their incorporation in comminuted meat products, and microbial study tells about the storage study.

Two scenarios of the problem environment are considered and the network is modelled using integer linear programming formulation. The grading of the products, based on the economic value associated with it, generates an additional cost in the form of grading cost and this cost is incorporated into the model developed. The model provides an optimal solution for the sample problem considered. The comparison of the results for the two scenarios shows the monetary benefits of recovering additional value associated with the used products. The network is analysed for different settings of the quantity of product return and it is found that the quantity of product return also has a significant effect on the selection of a suitable recovery option.

In recent years, however, consumers return products even before experiencing dissatisfaction and when products are not defective. Moreover, most consumers who return products are ordinary scrupulous people. Ironically, product returns are on the rise while overall product quality has improved. This suggests that there are other reasons for product returns yet to be uncovered. This study critically examines such types of recently observed product-return behaviors from the postpurchase dissonance (PPD) and ecological marketing perspectives. A proposition emerged through the critical review that in the current competitive and consumer-centered market environment, consumers increasingly choose product return over other options identified in the literature as a viable strategy to cope with their PPD. Two empirical studies and a recent major industry study on consumer product returns provided strong support for the proposition.

With emphasis on combining technological capabilities, enhancing performance levels, developing a fast redistribution system, and addressing common sustainable concerns, a successful partnership can be achieved between the 3PRLs and OEMs. An alliance between the OEM and 3PRL is such that either the OEM outsources all its reverse logistics (RL) activities to the provider or both parties collaborate for jointly planning and executing the RL operations through mutually shared infrastructure and facilities while sharing profits. However, from 3PRL provider’s perspective, a long-term view is needed to anticipate the economic viability of a collaborative system before entering into a logistics relationship with the manufacturers. As our contribution to the existing literature, we propose a fuzzy integer nonlinear programming model which can be used as a decision tool by 3PRLs for making this key decision of enhancing sustainability of the product recovery design. The proposed model is designed with the main objective of maximizing the profit generated by the multi-echelon RL network while analyzing the nature of the alliance to be formed between the OEMs and 3PRLs for each product to be recovered. The model also determines which clients (manufacturers) and how many clients to be acquired for maximum profitability. The core focus of the research is to exploit the maximum recoverable potential of the product returns and achieve a socially and environmentally sound and yet profitable RL system. The proposed model is validated by considering case study of a 3PRL offering product recovery services such as collection, repair, refurbishing, dismantling, and redistribution to manufacturers of electronic equipments. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.",Collaborative alliance; Product recovery services; Sustainability; Third party reverse logistics (3PRL),Computer system recovery; Distributed computer systems; Integer programming; Logistics; Manufacture; Nonlinear programming; Problem solving; Profitability; Recovery; Soft computing; Sustainable development; Collaborative alliance; Collaborative systems; Logistics providers; Original equipment manufacturers; Product recovery; Shared infrastructure; Technological capability; Third-party reverse logistics; Product design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964870770

In particular, this paper studies a cost-minimization model in which a firm offers acquisition price that impacts the quantity of the returns, and remanufactures the used product to satisfy the customer demand. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses multi-period stochastic dynamic programming theory to model a remanufacturing system that faces the random demand for remanufactured products. The number of the returns at each period is uncertain and increases linearly with the acquisition price offered. Findings: The study shows that when the uncertainty of demand for remanufactured products increases, the remanufacturer should hold a higher core stock level to minimize the expected total cost and thus a higher acquisition price is needed to attract returns. However, given demand uncertainty, the optimal price decreases in the initial core stock level in each period. It also indicates that the optimal acquisition price increases in the variance of the returns, but decreases in the mean of the returns. Practical implications: The findings suggest that a remanufacturer could reduce the expected total cost by adjusting the acquisition price according to the number of returns periodically. Originality/value: Introducing the impact of supply uncertainty on the acquisition price of used products, this paper uses a multi-period dynamic model, instead of single period model in previous studies, to examine the remanufacturer's dynamic acquisition pricing policy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0263-5577.",Closed-loop supply chain; Multi-period pricing; Supply uncertainty; Used-product returns,Customer satisfaction; Dynamic programming; Mergers and acquisitions; Product design; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Cost minimization models; Design/methodology/approach; Multi-period; Remanufactured products; Stochastic dynamic programming; Supply uncertainty; Used product; Costs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927772474

The paper culminates with a research model based on this theoretical perspective to examine the input and output of product returns management as part of a comprehensive sustainability effort. The study is exploratory in nature based on five case studies of participating manufacturers in the automotive, and electrical and electronics industry in Malaysia. The interview results reveal that the five participating companies established a product returns management program to handle three types of product returns found in their organizations. This is not surprising because successful product returns management has a number of internal and external benefits to the firms. Our interviews also uncover that the abundant amount of product returns is pressing these companies to implement an effective product returns management program. Based on the primary and secondary data collected in this study, three propositions are developed for future research, which should be tested with a large empirical data set to strengthen the theoretical contributions and managerial implications of this study. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Customer returns; Distribution returns; Manufacturing returns; Product recovery; Product returns,Abstracting; Automotive industry; Manufacture; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Customer returns; Distribution returns; Exploratory studies; Institutional theory; Managerial implications; Product recovery; Product returns; Research propositions; Electronics industry,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930376721

One of the most successful approaches for solving MMDPs utilizes coordination graphs (CG5), which encode the decouplings between the agents to reduce the dimension of the value function, which in turn reduces the computational complexity. However, it is typically assumed that the structure of the CG is available a priori, which is a limiting assumption for many practical scenarios. This work presents a randomized planning scheme based on the Bayesian optimization algorithm to probabilistically search over the space of CGs to discover CG structures that yield high return policies. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior in terms of convergence speed and accumulated reward.

This article explores FDM knowledge and opinions regarding return of genetic results in the context of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project, which does not return results to participants.Methods:Data collection included a survey completed by Organ Procurement Organization requesters (n = 22) and semistructured telephone interviews with FDM (n = 55).Results:Nearly every FDM wanted some form of genetic results returned. Information regarding treatable diseases (94.3%) and diseases that could affect their children (84.9%) were more desirable than that regarding untreatable diseases (71.7%). Sixty percent of FDMs understood that GTEx would not return genetic results. FDMs were four times more likely to have correct knowledge of the GTEx policy when their GTEx requester reported discussing the topic with them.Conclusion:FDMs from the GTEx project were interested in receiving genetic test results. Marked changes in the infrastructure of the GTEx would be required to alter the policy. Regardless, care must be taken to ensure that the return policy is clearly communicated with FDMs to dispel misconceptions. © 2016 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.",biobanking; bioethical issues; genetic research; incidental findings; return of results,Adult; Attitude; Biological Specimen Banks; Comprehension; Decision Making; Family; Female; Genetic Testing; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tissue Donors; adult; Article; biobanking; child; clinical research; controlled study; data collection method; family decision making; female; gene expression; genetic disorder; genetic procedures; genetic screening; genotype; health care organization; health care policy; health survey; human; human tissue; knowledge; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Organ Procurement Organization; organ transplantation; semi structured interview; telephone interview; tissue section; attitude; biobank; comparative study; comprehension; decision making; donor; ethics; family; genetic screening; interview; psychology; questionnaire,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954348740

Suppliers' contract status, seafood ingredient usage and satisfaction, expectations regarding prices of seafood ingredients, and willingness to pay when HACCP is taken into account were studied. Through random sampling, the survey was conducted on 231 dieticians in 11 different educational districts and 12 elementary, six middle, and three high schools. Ultimately, 142 survey responses were taken into account. Data analysis was performed using SPSS v15.0 by descriptive analysis, χ2-test, and t-test. For contracts regarding seafood ingredients, competitive contracts composed 79.7%. Exactly 42.1% responded that contracts were breached, and 60.1% testified that product returns were due to excessive glazing of ingredients. The satisfaction rate of 'hygiene & sanitation of product' was the highest, whereas 'price of product' was the lowest. For 'recontracting intention', 'informal purchasing' showed higher rates compared to 'competitive bidding'. Reflecting upon the six main price factors, 'designation and maintenance of HACCP', 'price of raw seafood ingredients', 'processing costs', 'margin', 'logistic costs', and 'cost of standardizing seafood ingredients', dieticians' perceived 'impact on the anticipated price' on total cost was lower than present counterparts. This implicates that 'impact on the present price' of the six price factors is too excessive, suggesting that many dieticians are unsatisfied with the current prices of seafood ingredients. Furthermore, 52.8% of dieticians stated that the maximum additional payment of HACCP seafood ingredients should be less than 5%. Consequently, this research serves as basic information for reasonable pricing of seafood ingredients and contributes to increased seafood usage by school food-services. © 2014, Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.

DT14 returns significantly higher eddy kinetic energy levels (+80%) within a 300 km coastal band, where mesoscale structures are known to induce important lateral physical and biogeochemical fluxes. When applied to DT14, an automatic eddy detection algorithm detects more eddies in the EBUS (+37%), and lower eddy radius estimates, in comparison with results using the former altimetry product (DT10).

This paper focuses on a problem of inventory control and production planning optimisation of a generic type of an integrated Reverse Logistics (RL) network which consists of a traditional forward production route, two alternative recovery routes, including repair and remanufacturing and a disposal route. It is assumed that demand and return quantities are uncertain. A quality level is assigned to each of the returned products. Due to uncertainty in the return quantity, quantity of returned products of a certain quality level is uncertain too. The uncertainties are modelled using fuzzy trapezoidal numbers. Quality thresholds are used to segregate the returned products into repair, remanufacturing or disposal routes. A two phase fuzzy mixed integer optimisation algorithm is developed to provide a solution to the inventory control and production planning problem. In Phase 1, uncertainties in quantity of product returns and quality of returns are considered to calculate the quantities to be sent to different recovery routes. These outputs are inputs into Phase 2 which generates decisions on component procurement, production, repair and disassembly. Finally, numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis are carried out to better understand the effects of quality of returns and RL network parameters on the network performance. These parameters include quantity of returned products, unit repair costs, unit production cost, setup costs and unit disposal cost. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Findings – It was found that dissatisfaction with a product results in an emotional dissonance that is positively related to product returns. Two primary reasons for return were examined, the expectation of the customer not being met and the customer finding a better product or price. Both reasons for return were found to influence the frequency of returns. It is also reported that gender, but not store brand moderated these relationships. Males had higher levels of product dissatisfaction and subsequent emotional dissonance than females. Males however did not have higher rates of return than females.

This is important as organizations can no longer ignore or accumulate returns at the back of the warehouse. This paper identifies the barriers that impede PRRM among manufacturing firms in Malaysia, and provide useful summary data and analysis to entice firms to consider adopting PPRM. This study reviewed 38 journal articles, which were subsequently validated through field interviews using multiple case study method. The content analysis reveals that the two major obstacles are financial and resource constraints, which fall within the category of internal barriers. However, the results of the interviews with six manufacturers in Malaysia indicate that external barriers are the main obstacles that hinder the adoption of PRRM, thus suggesting that there may be a subtle difference between the results reported in academic research and managers' perceptions of the barriers of product returns and recovery management. The external barriers, such as customers' operational performance and perception, are perceived by managers to be detrimental to the adoption of PRRM, which is contradictory to the academic findings. In addition, financial and resource constraints impede the adoption of PRRM. This suggests that further study should be conducted by expanding the sample size to continue to empirically explore the barriers of PRRM. This study helps policy makers in emerging countries in general and Malaysia, in particular, in setting appropriate policies and strategies to improve product returns and recovery of manufacturing firms. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The ruling in question concerns Italian national legislation which facilitates the imposition of criminal law sanctions on a third-country national who illegally enters the territory of a Member State accompanied by a breach of a previous entry ban. Although Advocate General Maciej Szpunar claimed in his opinion that such a national provision was incompatible with the main purpose of the Return Directive (which is, in principle, to return every undocumented migrant), the Court of Justice decided in the final judgment that the criminalisation of such an illegal entry should be allowed. Moreover, in its ruling, the Court of Justice suggests that authorities should differentiate between the first entry and subsequent entries and thus apply the provisions of the directive accordingly. The author analyses and compares the Advocate General's opinion with the final judgement of the Court and examines the consequences of the ruling for eu return policy. The ruling in question, which, in the author's opinion, has a precedent character and may raise controversies, implies a juxtaposition of conflicting values: the principle of effectiveness of the Return Directive as opposed to ensuring full respect for the rule of law, the effectiveness of law and of the principle of 'nullum crimen sine lege'. By giving priority to the principles of the rule of law and legal certainty, the Court clearly indicates that 'it is not a crime to be a foreigner,' yet the law imposes certain rules and duties on foreigners, which they must abide by, whereas the duty of Member States is to uphold the rule of law. © 2016 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",criminalisation of migration; entry ban; irregular migrants; Return Directive; return migration,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982972420

While many static one-size-fits-All approaches to limit product returns have been proposed, there is a gap in the literature regarding strategies based on individual consumption patterns. We introduce a decision support system for the prediction of product returns, including a new approach for large-scale feature extraction. This system can be used as the basis for a returns strategy that allows online retailers to intervene before problematic transactions even take place. Using a dataset containing 1,149,262 purchases obtained from a major German online retailer, we demonstrate that our decision support system can identify consumption patterns associated with a high product return rate at sufficient accuracy for such a strategy to be feasible.

The use and adoption of reverse logistics has increased with the start of product recalls, but the rise of e-commerce and insight into the positive environmental impact has elevated the formal use and sophistication of reverse logistics. There are many environmental issues that may arise from the production and transportation of products. The focus of this study is to evaluate supply chain environmental implications presented in a reverse logistic setting. These environmental contributions come with associated costs that can no longer be ignored in the mathematical modeling of reverse logistics. The model developed in this paper considers energy used for manufacturing and remanufacturing as well as greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing, remanufacturing and transportation activities with emissions penalty tax as per The European Union Emissions Trading System. The objective of the model is to develop a total cost function that is minimized by determining the following: the manufacturing batch size per cycle, the number of manufacturing batches per cycle, the number of remanufacturing batches per cycle, and the number of times an item may be remanufactured. Numerical examples are provided. The results show that optimizing for financial costs and all the environmental costs collectively promotes less remanufacturing to protect the environment as opposed to just focusing on solid waste disposal, which has been the focus of previous 'traditional' reverse logistics models that consider remanufacturing. In addition, the results show the need to increase the recollection of available used products that can be remanufactured. The proposed model is seen as a preliminary step into developing an environmentally responsible reverse logistics inventory model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy; Green supply chains; Greenhouse gas emissions; Remanufacturing; Reverse logistics,Carbon; Cost functions; Costs; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International law; Inventory control; Ionization of gases; Manufacture; Supply chains; Waste disposal; Energy; Environmental contributions; Environmental implications; Environmentally responsible; Green supply chain; Production and transportations; Remanufacturing; Reverse logistics; Logistics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938906540

The present study has addressed this gap in the literature by investigating the perceptions and behavior of West African immigrants to Canada in both contexts. The objectives of this study are: (i) to gain a better understanding of the modes of acculturation of West African immigrants in Canada; (ii) to relate these modes of acculturation to consumers’ perceived likelihood of successful complaint and complaining behavior; and (iii) to compare consumers’ complaint attitudes and behavior in their home countries (i.e., original countries) and the host country (Canada). An empirical study is conducted among a sample of 218 immigrants living in Canada and originating from several West African countries. The results show that the vast majority of respondents fall into one of two acculturation groups: (i) an ‘integrated’ group; and (ii) a ‘separated’ group. The findings also show that, irrespective of whether they were ‘integrated’ or ‘separated’, West African immigrants perceived that a complaint was more likely to be successful in Canada than in their home countries. Moreover, irrespective of whether they were ‘integrated’ or ‘separated’, West African immigrants to Canada tended to complain more (to a third party or via ‘voicing’) in Canada than in their home countries. Given that the host country presents a more favorable environment for complaint behavior (in terms of consumer protection, after-sales service, return policies, and so on) than their home countries, it would seem that West African immigrants were inclined to change their behavior if they believe that their complaints will be taken seriously. In contrast to these findings regarding ‘third party’ or ‘voicing’ complaints, no significant differences were found between behavior in the host country and behavior in the home countries with respect to ‘negative word of mouth’ and ‘exit’. The likely explanation for this is that these are the easiest and least costly ways of expressing dissatisfaction (whether people are in their home countries or in the host country). © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.",,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145094034

We find that when consumers have the option to self-mend a product to assure a proper fit, an online retailer can devise its return policy to encourage or suppress consumer mending as a fit-uncertainty mitigating mechanism. First, our analysis shows that an online retailer benefits from easing the return policy and lowering the consumer return cost if the value of a good fit product is low, but benefits from tightening the return policy and maintaining a reasonable return cost for consumers if the value of a good fit product is high. Second, we find that in the parameter region where the value of a good fit product is high but not too high, a tightened return policy leads to a greater consumer surplus in addition to an increased retailer profit, suggesting a win-win situation and improved social efficiency. And even beyond this win-win region, the social welfare may still increase with tightened return policy when the gains in retailer profit or consumer surplus exceeds the loss of the other party. Finally, we show that when the value of a good fit product is sufficiently high, the capability of manipulating consumer mending as a fit-uncertainty mitigating mechanism allows a pure online retailer to earn a greater profit than a dual channel retailer that sells the product through both the online and the offline channels. Our theoretical insights provide explanations to many interesting practices in the online retailing industry. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Fit uncertainty; Mending; Online retailing; Return policy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942990220

The arrival of returns with high variability is modeled with a hyperexponential renewal process and that of returns with low variability is modeled with a Poisson process. The remanufacturing facility can process the returned products in two ways. For the first way, each type of returns is remanufactured by a dedicated capacity. For the second way, returns from two different markets are remanufactured by a merged capacity. Analytical queueing models with the time value of money consideration are proposed for the admission decision, which decides on the acceptance or not of returned products based on quality and processing time. The proposed modeling determines the admission decision threshold value in order to maximize the total expected profit of the remanufacturing system. Our analysis also allows to study the interaction between the overall utilization and the arrival process variability.

To ensure quality and safety of the tissue, frozen tissue must be shipped in insulated containers such that tissue is maintained at an appropriate temperature.

To maintain an expiry date for frozen tissue longer than 6 months, the tissue must be maintained at a temperature of −40 °C or below. The objective of this study was to evaluate and validate the capability of a commercially available insulated polystyrene carton (XPL10), packed with dry ice, to maintain tissue temperature below −40 °C. Tissue temperature of a single frozen femoral head or a single frozen Achilles tendon, was recorded over a 4-day period at 37 °C, inside a XPL10 carton with dry ice as refrigerant. The data demonstrate that at 37 °C, the XPL10 carton with 9.5 kg of dry ice maintained femoral head and tendon tissue temperature below −55 °C for at least 48 h; tissue temperature did not rise above −40 °C until at least 70 h.

Under the return policy, the supplier as a brand owner may focus on production, and then outsource retailing to the retailer. In the meanwhile, the retailer may receive some support money from the supplier for subsidizing the loss of unsold products at the end of the selling season and be asked for shipping back. Motivated by this real practice in the fashion industry, we examine a two-echelon supply chain with one supplier and one retailer under the return policy. Several interesting findings are obtained from our analysis. First, we find that when the supply chain achieves channel coordination, the cost of physical return is at least partially borne by the supplier, no matter who is responsible for it in reality. Second, we find that the cost of physical return is significantly affecting the sustainability factors such as the expected amount leftover (which represents environmental friendliness), the expected sales to expected goods leftover ratio (which implies both environmental friendliness and economic sustainability), and the rate of return on investment (which indicates economic sustainability). Third, from a sustainability perspective, we find that the pure wholesale price contract is more sustainable than the coordinating return policy.

The problem is to optimally allocate the most profitable land use activities including agriculture, carbon sequestration, environmental planting, bio-fuel, bio-energy, etc., and is constrained to satisfy some food demand considerations and expansion policies for each year from 2013 to 2050. In this research we produce a higher resolution solution by dividing Australia’s agricultural areas into square kilometer cells, which leads to more than thirteen million cells to be assigned, totally or partially, to different activities. By accepting a scenario on agricultural products' return, carbon related activities, future energy prices, water availability, global climate change, etc. a linear programming problem is composed for each year. However, even by using a state of the art commercial LP solver it takes a long time to find an optimal solution for one year. Therefore, it is almost impossible to think about simultaneous scenarios to be incorporated, as the corresponding model will become even larger. Based on the properties of the problem, such as similar economical and geographical properties of nearby land parcels, the combination of clustering ideas with column generation to decompose the large problem into smaller sub-problems yields a computationally efficient algorithm for the large scale problem. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.",Aggregation-disaggregation; Clustering; Column generation; Land use allocation,Agricultural products; Application programs; Carbon; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Linear programming; Clustering; Column generation; Computationally efficient; Disaggregation; Disaggregation techniques; Land use allocation; Large-scale LP problems; Linear programming problem; Land use,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922832702

It permits to forecast product returns on the basis of fewer restrictions than existing approaches in CLSC literature. A numerical example demonstrates the application of the proposed approach using return times drawn from a Poisson distribution. – The Bayesian estimation approach provides at least 50 percent higher accuracy in terms of error measures compared to traditional methods in all scenarios examined in the empirical part. Hence, more precise results can be obtained when predicting product returns. – The flexibility of the proposed approach allows for numerous applications in the field of CLSC research. Areas that depend on the results from a forecasting system, such as inventory management, can embed our estimation procedure in order to reduce safety stocks. Further research should address the incorporation of the quality of returned products and its impact on the actual utilizable amount of product returns. – The generic character of the proposed forecasting approach leaves degrees of freedom to the user when adapting it to a specific problem. This adaptability is enabled by the following features: first, an arbitrary function is allowed for capturing the customers' demand. Second, the stochastic timeframe between sale and product return may follow an arbitrary distribution. Third, by adjusting two parameters finite as well as infinite planning horizons can be incorporated. Fourth, no assumptions regarding the joint distribution of product returns are necessary. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Bayesian statistics; Closed-loop supply chains; Forecasting; Product returns,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883391234

Using a constant elasticity of substitution production function, the model is then extended to enable coverage of real world situations. Using waste paper as a reference raw material, we empirically estimate the parameters of the system. By using these regression results, we are able to show that the equilibrium solution is a Lyapunov unstable saddle point. This implies that the system is sensitive on initial conditions that will hence impede the predictability of product returns.

We conceptualize the nature of product fit uncertainty as an information problem and theorize its distinct effect on product returns and consumer satisfaction (versus product quality uncertainty), particularly for experience (versus search) goods without product familiarity. To reduce product fit uncertainty, we propose two Internet-enabled systems-website media (visualization systems) and online product forums (collaborative shopping systems)-that are hypothesized to attenuate the effect of product type (experience versus search goods) on product fit uncertainty. Hypotheses that link experience goods to product returns through the mediating role of product fit uncertainty are tested with analyses of a unique data set composed of secondary data matched with primary direct data from numerous consumers who had recently participated in buy-it-now auctions. The results show the distinction between product fit uncertainty and quality uncertainty as two distinct dimensions of product uncertainty and interestingly show that, relative to product quality uncertainty, product fit uncertainty has a significantly stronger effect on product returns. Notably, whereas product quality uncertainty is mainly driven by the experience attributes of a product, product fit uncertainty is mainly driven by both experience attributes and lack of product familiarity. The results also suggest that Internet-enabled systems are differentially used to reduce product (fit and quality) uncertainty. Notably, the use of online product forums is shown to moderate the effect of experience goods on product fit uncertainty, and website media are shown to attenuate the effect of experience goods on product quality uncertainty. The results are robust to econometric specifications and estimation methods. The paper concludes by stressing the importance of reducing the increasingly prevalent information problem of product fit uncertainty in online markets with the aid of Internet-enabled systems. ©2014 INFORMS.",Expectation confirmation theory; Internet-enabled systems; Online markets; Product fit uncertainty; Product quality uncertainty; Product returns,Electronic commerce; Online systems; Quality control; Websites; Expectation Confirmation Theory; Online markets; Product fit uncertainty; Product returns; Quality uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903895408

Prior empirical finding reveals that suppliers in practice tend to help their trading partners improve forecast accuracy. This paper examines this issue and explores the up-down (from an upstream supplier to a downstream retailer) strategic information sharing issues in a two-echelon supply chain. We first model a supply chain with forecast updating and returns policy. The forecast updating scheme adopts the Bayesian approach with unknown mean and unknown variance. We then proceed to analytically explore the effects of forecast updating on the supplier and the retailer. Our analysis has revealed that: 1. Demand information with low relevance can lead to a loss to the retailer. 2. In the absence of returns policy, the supplier has an incentive to provide ""bad information"" which may be harmful to the retailer. 3. The supplier will provide ""good information"" to the retailer only under the returns policy. 4. With up-down information sharing, win-win coordination can be achieved by using a proper returns policy. Many of these results can supplement and challenge the prior research findings that supplier has good incentive to help retailers in improving forecast. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Forecast updating; Returns policy; Supply chain management,Bayesian networks; Forecasting; Information analysis; Supply chain management; Bayesian approaches; Demand information; Empirical findings; Forecast accuracy; Information sharing; Returns policies; Trading partners; Two-echelon supply chain; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889097145

In our model, a seller sells to consumers with heterogeneous valuations and hassle costs. Products are subject to quality risk, and product misfit can only be observed post-purchase. While the hassle-free policy is cost advantageous from the seller's viewpoint, a money-back guarantee allows the seller to fine-tune the consumer hassle on returning the product. Thus, when the two return policies lead to the same consumer behaviors, the hassle-free policy dominates. Conversely, a money-back guarantee can be more profitable even if on average, high-valuation consumers experience a lower hassle cost than the low-valuation ones. The optimal hassle cost can be higher when product quality gets improved; thus, it is not necessarily a perfect proxy or signal of the seller's quality.

Interestingly, we find that a higher use of alternative photos is associated with more returns and, perhaps more importantly, with lower net sales. Color swatch, on the other hand, does not seem to have any effect on returns. Thus, our findings show that different technologies have different effects on product returns. We provide explanations for these findings based on the extant literature. We also conduct a number of tests to ensure the robustness of the results. © 2013, INFORMS.",Econometric models; Online shopping; Product returns; Product-oriented technologies; Type of information,Hardware; Information systems; Econometric model; Exploratory studies; Internet retailers; Negative coefficients; Online shopping; Product returns; Technology usages; Type of information; Web crawler,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891813074

Stronger (weaker) rule responses to inflation (output) increase expected excess returns. Policy shocks substantially increase asset-return volatility.

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a case study research strategy. It draws on a single case, comprised of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and its two retailers. It utilizes an in-depth semi structured interviewing approach, combined with walk-through observations. Findings: The study finds that management of retail product returns can significantly benefit both an OEM and its customers when appropriate SCI enabling practices are deployed. While these practices are similar to those in forward supply chain processes, barriers are driven by the characteristics of product returns processes. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study stem primarily from its methodological design. A single case research strategy provides a limited opportunity for external generalization of the research findings. Practical implications: This study illustrates the value of SCI initiatives in product returns processes and informs managers' decision making in the planning and execution of similar SCI implementations in product returns processes. Originality/value: This research claims to be one of the first works that systematically and empirically explores SCI in reverse supply chain processes, as opposed to forward supply chain processes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Product returns; Retailing; Returns; Returns management; Reverse logistics; Supply chain integration; Supply chain management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880617730

The latter has a dual purpose. On one hand, it leads to higher sales and plays the traditional role of marketing tool. On the other hand, it increases the return rate, playing the role of an operational tool. The players evaluate the convenience of collaborating in a CLSC (collaborative remanufacturing) by pursuing both marketing and operational targets implementing a Reverse Revenue Sharing Contract (RRSC). Our findings suggest that green advertising should aim to increase customers' knowledge and awareness about the return policy because collaboration is successful only when the returns' residual value is large while the sharing parameter is not too high. Moreover, the inefficiencies that RRSC carries out limit substantially its adoption. A RRSC is payoff-Pareto-improving only in few cases. Finally, we highlight the limitations of previous research in supply chain contracting, which has disregarded the administrative costs of using a two-parameter contract; this lack of consideration leads to imprecise findings and managerial prescriptions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Closed-loop supply chain; Differential game; Feedback equilibrium; Green advertising; Reverse Revenue Sharing Contract,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906078499

One such underlying reason is cognitive dissonance. Customers who experience cognitive dissonance may seek to undo the effects of a regretted choice by returning the product in question. This research examines the influence of two forms of cognitive dissonance (emotional dissonance and product dissonance) on the frequency of product returns. Three antecedents (consideration of liberal return policies, customer opportunism, and switching barriers) are examined in terms of their influence on cognitive dissonance and product returns. In addition, the moderating role of gender and store brand is reported. The research is based on a survey of Wal-Mart and Target customers who engaged in product returns. Structural equation modeling is used to verify and test these relationships. Emotional dissonance and product dissonance were found to be positively related to product returns frequency. It was found that consideration of liberal return policies reduces both emotional and product dissonance, while customer opportunism and switching barriers increase both dimensions of cognitive dissonance. Both gender and store brand were found to be significant moderators of the relationships between cognitive dissonance and two antecedents (consideration of liberal return policies and customer opportunism). In addition, gender and store brand moderated the linkage between product dissonance and emotional dissonance, and the linkage between emotional dissonance and return frequency. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880002823

To be specific, we model the stochastic fashion MC program with the consideration of consumer demand uncertainty. If a consumer return policy is implemented, we further consider return uncertainty. By modeling the optimization objective of the risk averse MC fashion brand via a mean-variance approach, we derive the closed-form optimal solution under each case. We then conduct both analytical and numerical sensitivity analyses. For the scenario with full refund and return, we reveal the analytical conditions under which the optimal retail price and the optimal number of options available for customization (called the ""optimal modularity level"") vary monotonically with respect to the salvage value and the return service charge. For the scenario when there is no refund and return, we show that the optimal retail price and the optimal modularity level are decreasing in the MC fashion brand's degree of risk aversion, the demand uncertainty, and the price-demand sensitivity coefficient. In addition, our numerical analysis indicates that whether the risk averse MC fashion brand would prefer offering consumer return with full refund to no return depends heavily on the demand-return correlation (DRC) parameter. © 2013 Tsan-Ming Choi et al.",,Computer aided manufacturing; Stochastic models; Analytical conditions; Consumer return policies; Demand uncertainty; Mass customization; Mean-variance approach; Numerical sensitivity; Optimal retail price; Sensitivity coefficient; Optimization,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877267293

Considering the significant impact of product returns on the company's bottom line, a growing number of companies have attempted to streamline the reverse logistics process. Products are usually returned to initial collection points (ICPs) in small quantities and thus increase the unit shipping cost due to lack of freight discount opportunities. One way to address this issue is to aggregate the returned products into a larger shipment. However, such aggregation increases the holding time at the ICP, which in turn increases the inventory carrying costs. Considering this logistics dilemma, the main objectives of this research are to minimize the total cost by determining the optimal location and collection period of holding time of ICPs; determining the optimal location of a centralized return centre; transforming the nonlinear objective function of the proposed model formulation by Min et al. (2006a) into a linear form; and conducting a sensitivity analysis to the model solutions according to varying parameters such as shipping volume. Existing models and solution procedures are too complicated to solve real-world problems. Through a series of computational experiments, we discovered that the linearization model obtained the optimal solution at a fraction of the time used by the traditional nonlinear model and solution procedure, as well as the ability to handle up to 150 customers as compared to 30 in the conventional nonlinear model. As such, the proposed linear model is more suitable for actual industry applications than the existing models. © 2014 The Author(s).",Linear transformation; Optimization; Reverse logistics,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925844988

The existence of its optimal policy has yet been confirmed. In addition, the IT platform nowadays has been well developed so that user phase alignment could be executed at relatively low cost and it is a global phenomenon for companies to pursue cross-tier stretch along its value chain. In this study, a supply chain model comprised of three major biz entities (warehouse, remanufacturing facility and user phase) is presented. An optimal (s,S) type policy for this model is first introduced under the non-leadtime assumption and then extended to the leadtime scenario. The theoretically optimal policy is not applicable as a consequence of lacking information with regard to the failure product's return flow. In order to solve this issue, data mining within the user phase is executed and the specification of user phase information that serves to implementing the optimal policy is articulated. Additionally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the optimality of the (s,S) type policy and the contribution of user phase information sharing to inventory cost reduction. © Copyright 2014 by DEStech Publications, Inc.

Specifically, consumer returns are allowed in the initial sales. Then, we introduce a secondary market to salvage the returns and the leftovers from the initial sales. In this secondary market, a discount price will be offered to the consumers but no returns are accepted. Moreover, between the primary and the secondary market, there is an internal market where retailers can trade among themselves so that they are able to adjust their inventory levels to prepare for the sales in the secondary market. We study the retailers' and the supply chain's inventory decision in this case and highlight the impact of the secondary market on the sales as well as on the supply chain coordination contracts. We conclude that the secondary market helps us to increase the total wholesale volume. Numerical examples show that the total sales profit is also increased. However, the secondary market aggravates the incentive conflict between the retailers and the supply chain on deciding the optimal inventory levels and hence requires the supplier to offer more generous buyback or sales rebate contracts for coordination of the supply chain. Finally, we extend our analysis to more general cases and also show that our results are robust to some of the modeling assumptions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Consumer returns; Secondary market; Supply chain; Supply contracts,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893360323

For firms, it has become important to manage the reverse flow of products in an efficient way to obtain competitive advantage. However to design RL network is difficult because of some reasons. Especially, uncertain parameters related to return product quantity, quality and time are main characteristics of RL networks. One of the most important decisions of RL is to provide a correct and timely estimation of return waste product quantity, because it affects many decisions related to RL network design process directly. To predict return product in RL networks, intrinsic and extrinsic forecasting are some of the well-known and frequently used forecasting techniques. In this study, we proposed a grey forecasting system to forecast return product quantity in RL network. The contribution of this study is the first study that presented grey forecasting model for product return quantity in reverse logistics network design literature. Solutions showed that grey forecasting system is very efficient to predict return quantity. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.",e-waste; grey systems; return product forecasting; Reverse logistics; uncertainty,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949804558

Given a set of customers with different preferences on the features of the products, we want to select at most k products from a pool of candidate products such that their total number of potential customers is maximized. Two versions of the problem are defined according to whether the competitive existing products are given. For solving this NP-hard problem, we first propose an incremental greedy approach to find an approximate solution of the problem with quality guaranteed. For further speeding up this basic greedy approach, we exploit several properties of the top-t queries and skyline queries to reduce the solution space of the problem. In addition, an upper bound of the potential customers is estimated to reduce the cost of computing the reverse top-t queries for the candidate products. Finally, when the candidate products are formed from multiple component tables, we propose a strategy to reduce the number of the accessed tuples in the component tables such that only the tuples that are possibly components of the top-t favorites of the customers need to be accessed. By applying these pruning strategies, we propose another faster greedy approach. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed pruning strategies work very well and make the faster greedy algorithms for both versions of the problem achieve excellent performance on both efficiency and memory utilization. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Maximum coverage problem; Potential customers; Query processing; Reverse top-t query,Computational complexity; Query processing; Approximate solution; Greedy algorithms; Maximum coverage; Memory utilization; Multiple components; Potential customers; Quality guaranteed; Reverse top-t query; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904562527

Product failures, which occur in service, are often caused by root causes at design or at manufacturing phases. Therefore a novel inter-loop modelling framework is needed which takes information from different phases to determine root causes and corrective actions. This goes beyond current intra-loop methods such as design optimization, statistical process control etc., which uses information from a single phase to address failures in the same phase. However, inter-loop modelling poses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous data from different phases of lifecycle with product and process models to determine failure root causes and corrective actions. To deal with failures in service, this paper proposes Closed-loop Lifecycle Modelling approach, specifically integrating information from service and design. Related work on fault diagnosis and corrections is also reviewed in the context of intra and inter loops of product lifecycle. The proposed methodology addresses root cause analysis (RCA) of service failures caused due to dimensional variations of product features. RCA identifies critical geometric features of internal components, which affects dimensional variations of product features. This is done by integrating warranty data from service to design models such as CAD, Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T) etc. Steps of the methodology include: (i) identification of faulty product features from the Ishikawa diagram of the failure reported in warranty; (ii) variation simulation analysis of geometric features of internal components; (iii) determination of critical geometric features affecting faulty product feature via surrogate modelling of dimensional variations; and (iv) analyzing sensitivity of faulty product features on critical geometric features. The proposed Design-Service inter loop is demonstrated by an industrial case study of automotive ignition switch and 'Sticky Key' service failure. RCA of 'Sticky Key' issue identifies critical geometric features and their sensitivity in affecting the faulty product features, which cause the failure. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Design paramters; Functional requirements; Product lifecycle; Product service failures; Root cause analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Surrogate modelling; Variation simulation,Customer satisfaction; Data integration; Design; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Geometry; Large scale systems; Product design; Sensitivity analysis; Statistical process control; Functional requirement; Product service; Product-life-cycle; Root cause analysis; Surrogate modelling; Variation simulations; Life cycle,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84915760724

One major source of such inefficiencies is product returns. Indeed, product returns in Internet retailing have been shown to be, on average, as high as 22% of sales. Yet, most retailers accept them as a necessary cost of doing business. This is not surprising since many retailers do not have a clear understanding of the causes of product returns. While it is known that return policies of retailers, along with product attributes, are two important factors related to product return incidents, little is known about which aspects of the online retail transaction make such a purchase more return-prone. In the current study, we seek to address this issue. We use a large data set of customer purchases and returns to identify how process attributes in physical distribution service (PDS) influence product returns. The first attribute involves perceptions of scarcity conditions in inventory availability among consumers when retailers reveal to consumers information on inventory levels for the products that they intend to buy. Our results show that orders in which items are sold when these conditions are revealed to shoppers have a higher likelihood of being returned than orders in which these conditions are not revealed. While prior research has argued that inventory scarcity perceptions have an effect on purchases, our findings suggest that they are also related to the likelihood of these purchases being returned. The second attribute involves the reliability in the delivery of orders to consumers. We find that the likelihood of orders being returned depends on the consistency between retailer promises of timeliness in the delivery of orders and the actual delivery performance of the orders. Moreover, we find that the effect that consistency in the delivery has in the likelihood of returns, is stronger for orders that involve promises for expedited delivery than for orders with less expeditious promises. That is, although the occurrence of returns depends on the delays in the delivery of orders to consumers relative to the initial promises made by the retailers, this effect is more notable for orders that involve promises of fast delivery. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Electronic commerce; Online retailing; Order fulfillment; Physical distribution; Returns,Electronic commerce; Industrial engineering; Operations research; Purchasing; Day-to-day operations; Delivery performance; Distribution services; Online retailing; Order fulfillment; Physical distribution; Product attributes; Returns; Condition; Internet retailers; Internet retailing; Product returns; Return; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904648184

Let us consider a forecast of demands and product returns over a finite planning horizon - the problem is to determine an optimal production plan. This consists of either manufacturing new products or remanufacturing returned units, and in this way meets both demands at minimum costs. The costs of course are the fixed set-up expenses associated with manufacturing and/or remanufacturing lots and also the inventory holding costs of stocks kept on hand. In addition to showing that a general instance of this problem is NP-Hard, we develop an alternative mixed-integer model formulation for this problem and contrast it to the formulation commonly used in the literature. We show that when integrality constraints are relaxed, our formulation obtains better bounds. Our formulation incorporates the fact that every optimal solution can be decomposed into a series of well-structured blocks with distinct patterns in the way in which set-ups for manufacturing and remanufacturing occur. We then construct a dynamic programming based heuristic that exploits the block structure of the optimal solution. We also propose some improvement schemes as well. Finally, our numerical testing shows that the heuristic performs very well as intended. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Manufacturers explore various options including disassembly operations to recover components and subassemblies for reuse, remanufacture, and recycle to extend the life of materials in use and cut down the disposal volume. However, disassembly operations are problematic due to high degree of uncertainty associated with the quality and configuration of product returns. In this research we address the disassembly line balancing problem (DLBP) using a Monte-Carlo based reinforcement learning technique. This reinforcement learning approach is tailored fit to the underlying dynamics of a DLBP. The research results indicate that the reinforcement learning based method is able to perform effectively, even on a complex large scale problem, within a reasonable amount of computational time. The proposed method performed on par or better than the benchmark methods for solving DLBP reported in the literature.

The main motivation of this study is to improve the performance of closed loop supply chains using a divide and conquer optimization scheme. In this paper, it is shown that the manner in which the closed loop supply chain is divided into various subsystems, the way in which interactions between the subsystems are handled and the optimization sequence adopted can help to improve the profitability of the supply chain with minimal computational load.

Given demands and returns over a planning horizon, DLRR is to determine a production schedule of manufacturing new products and/or remanufacturing returns such that demand in each period is satisfied and the total cost (set-up cost plus holding cost of inventory) is minimized.Since DLRR with general cost functions for set-ups of manufacturing and remanufacturing is NP-hard, we develop a tabu search to produce high-quality solutions. To generate a good initial solution, we use a block-chain based method where the planning horizon is split into a chain of blocks. A block may contain either a string of manufacturing set-ups, a string of remanufacturing set-ups, or both. Given the cost of each block, an initial solution corresponding to a best combination of blocks is found by solving a shortest-path problem. Neighboring operators aim at shifting integer variables for manufacturing and remanufacturing set-ups.We evaluate our algorithm on 6480 benchmark problems and compare it with other available algorithms. Computational results demonstrate that our algorithm produces an optimal solution in 96.60% of benchmark problems, with an average deviation of 0.00082% from optimality and it is a state-of-the-art method for DLRR. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Dynamic lot sizing; Product returns; Production planning and scheduling; Remanufacturing; Tabu search,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877336856

Many conceptual and analytical models have been developed for addressing the ordering problem, but they hardly considered the environmental sustainability of a supply chain and other reality conditions. Based on credibility theory, this paper presents three fuzzy mathematical programming models to select the appropriate suppliers and allocate order quantities, addressing the carbon emission, fuzzy demand, product return and shortage issues, in order to match reality more exactly.

Design/methodology/approach: The most important factors which have impact on return of products are defined. Then the factors which have collinearity with others are eliminated by using dimension redundancy analysis. By training data of selected factors with fuzzy expert system, the return amounts of alternative cities are forecasted. Findings: The performance metrics of the proposed model are found as satisfactory. That means the result of this study indicates that fuzzy expert systems can be used as a supportive tool for forecasting return quantity of alternative areas. Research limitations/implications: In the future, the proposed model can be used for forecasting other uncertain parameters such as return quality and return time. Other fuzzy systems such as type-2 fuzzy sets can be used, or other expert systems such as artificial neural networks can be integrated into fuzzy systems. Practical implications: An application at an e-recycling facility is conducted for clarifying how the method is used in a real decision process. Originality/value: It is the first study which aims to model an alternative forecasting by utilizing fuzzy expert system. Furthermore, a comprehensive factor list which includes predictors of the system is defined.

It is assumed that the transportation cost not only depends on the lot size, but also depends on the gasoline price uncertainty. The purpose is to determine the optimal production–shipment policy for the proposed model by taking into account the percentage of defective items, transportation cost, setup cost, screening cost, holding cost, and carbon emission cost. The objective is to determine the optimal number of shipments and the optimal order quantity that minimize the expected total cost per unit time. Expressions for the optimal order quantity, the optimal number of shipments, the optimal number of buyer’s cycle during which the defective items are stored at the buyer’s warehouse before shipping them to the vendor are derived by minimizing the expected total cost per unit time. In order to illustrate the proposed model, a numerical example is presented and results are discussed. It is found that as the gasoline price uncertainty increases, both the total cost and shipment size increase. This shows that the gasoline price influences the supply chain coordination. Moreover, when the fixed gasoline consumption depending on the vehicle size, type, or age increases, shipment size increases, the number of shipments decreases, and the total cost increases. This implies that when the truck size or type used for shipping changes, the supply chain coordination decision will also change. The variable gasoline consumption increases the total cost of the supply chain. Finally, a similar behavior is observed with respect to fixed and variable carbon emissions costs for the buyer. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955165299

This paper studies an optimal supplier selection problem in the fashion apparel supply chain in the presence of carbon emission tax. We consider the scenario in which there are multiple suppliers in the market. In the basic model, each supplier offers a supply lead time and a wholesale pricing contract to the fashion retail buyer. For the fashion retail buyer, the supplier which offers a shorter lead time allows it to postpone the ordering decision with updated and better forecast, and also a smaller carbon tax. However, the wholesale price is usually larger. We propose a two-phase optimal supplier selection scheme in which phase one filters the inferior suppliers and phase two helps to select the best supplier among the set of non-inferior suppliers by multi-stage stochastic dynamic programming. The impacts brought by different formats of carbon emission tax are explored. Finally, we examine an extended model in which there is a local supplier who offers a buyback contract and accepts product returns.

The literature primarily focuses on the design of the contract parameters to ensure channel coordination, whereas much less attention is given to the analysis of conditions supporting contract implementation. This study focuses on implementation of the Return policy with a Sales Rebate and Penalty (RSRP) contract as a coordination mechanism. The negotiation and trading procedure among supply chain members is modeled using a simulation optimization-based decision support tool. The possibility that retailers impose their own preferences that disturb channel coordination after signing the RSRP contract is analyzed, and a new Limited Return policy with a Sales Rebate and Penalty (LRSRP) contract, which helps the supplier guarantee channel coordination and control retailer decisions, is proposed. © 2014 Sharif University of Technology.

We examine the situation in which a seller makes price and quantity decisions and also designs an appropriate returns policy in order to maximize his profit. The seller may offer either a fullrefund or a partial-refund policy if he decides to accept returns or chooses not to accept any returns. With the full-refund policy, the seller reimburses the consumer the full price of the product if it does not fit the customer's preferences. With a partial-refund policy, the seller offers a refund which is strictly less than the purchase price.

Recent business press refers to this browse-and-switch behavior as ""showrooming,"" and attributes to it the declining profits of brick-and-mortar retailers. To study the effect of the browse-and-switch option on retail and online pricing strategies and profits, we analyze a stylized economic model that incorporates uncertainty in consumers' valuation of the product, captures the heterogeneity among consumers in their inclination to purchase online, and permits product returns. We consider various equilibrium scenarios for different combinations of consumer shopping behaviors, characterize the parameter ranges for each scenario, and demonstrate that browse-and-switch behavior can indeed occur under equilibrium.

Since both the demands and product returns are uncertain, we consider two types of risks: overstocking and understocking of multiproducts in the forward supply chain. Then we set up the Cournot-Nash equilibrium conditions of the CLSC network whereby we maximize every oligopolistic firm's expected profit by deciding the production quantities of each new product as well as the path flows of each product on the forward supply chain.

Consequently, the importance of reverse logistics (RL), has grown significantly in recent years. In order to maintain effective and efficient RL operations, enterprises adopt various approaches to improve their performance, such as Balanced Scorecard (BSC). In this research paper, a comprehensive RL performance measurement model is first developed by integrating BSC, and performance prism, thus, rectifying the drawbacks in previous frameworks while incorporating their strengths. Moreover, the RL performance is affected by different factors, for example resources utilization, productivity, and it is always difficult for decision-makers to improve all aspects at the same time. Another factor from the published frameworks assumes independence of performance factors. Nonetheless in the real world, such performance factors are seldom independent. In view of the constraint of various resources, this paper brings forward an important issue on how to enhance RL performance by clustering complex yet influential factors into groups to improve them in a stepwise way. To address this concern, an effective method called decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), is utilized. Considering the interdependence among these factors, the DEMATEL method produces a cause and effect relationship diagram. The performance factors are divided into these cause and effect groups, which enable the handling of inner dependences within a set of factors. The following proposed model contributes to enhance this RL enterprise performance, provides milestones for a performance measurement system design, and achieves targets of RL operations. Furthermore, the causal model development can help in the decision-making process as well as proposing suggestions to improve the enterprise performance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this perspective closed-loop supply chains are considered as the most feasible solution. However, their implementation within the paradigm of prevailing open-loop product systems seems extremely complicated and practically infeasible. This paper argues for a radical shift in thinking on the closed-loop systems and presents the novel concept of Resource Conservative Manufacturing (ResCoM). The ResCoM concept considers the conservation of energy, material and value added with waste prevention and environment protection as integrated components of the product design and development strategy. It also presents the innovative idea of products with multiple lifecycles where several lifecycles of predefined duration are determined already at the product design stage thus demanding for new design strategies and methodologies. To succeed with this concept ResCoM advocates for new approach to supply chain design and business models as well, where the customers are integral part of manufacturing enterprises and the product design is effectively connected with the supply chain design. This work concludes that the products, supply chains and the business models developed for open-loop product systems are unable to cope with the dynamics of closed-loop systems. The uncertainties associated with product returns are inherent to the conventional concept of lifecycle and closed-loop systems. The ResCoM concept has much better capability in dealing with these uncertainties while developing sustainable closed-loop systems.

If more-step ahead forecasts of product returns are required, estimating sales data is necessary. This is accomplished by adopting growth curve models based on the extended Kalman filter. In order to capture the process generating product returns more adequately than in the literature, we propose an adaptive Bayesian approach to forecast future returns. The combination of these two concepts enables us to conduct more-step ahead forecasts. We evaluate the robustness of this approach against Holts approach, a Kalman filter based approach, and the model by Toktay et al.

The retailer selects its assortment from an exogenous set of horizontally differentiated products. Consumers make purchase and keep/return decisions in nested multinomial logit fashion. Our main finding is that the optimal assortment has a distinct structure for relatively strict return policies: it is optimal to offer a mix of the most popular and most eccentric products when the refund amount is sufficiently low, which can be viewed as a form of risk sharing between the retailer and consumers. In contrast, if the refund is sufficiently high or when returns are disallowed, the optimal assortment is composed of only the most popular products (a common finding in the literature).

However, as pico-PV is a comparatively new technology, relatively little is known about appropriate methods for sustainable product development and deployment. For this reason current dissemination methods are often ineffective and unsustainable. This research aims to help project developers deploy pico-PV technologies successfully and in a sustainable manner. To achieve this, a conceptual framework of key sustainability criteria along the value chain was developed and tested. The analysis revealed that the most important criteria for the sustainable deployment of pico-PV systems are: (a) easy and safe operation of the product; (b) that a system for product return is established; (c) the retailer understands the target market and (d) the end-user is aware of the product's existence and its benefits. This research reveals that criteria (b) and (c) are of greatest concern. In light of these findings, the authors propose to focus on the following five factors; namely: (a) raising awareness for certification and creating market reassurance; (b) introducing support mechanisms to facilitate local repair; (c) using existing supply channels and establishing in-country (dis)assembly; (d) introducing financial support mechanisms at product supply stages and; (e) undertaking marketing campaigns. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results indicate that monopoly e-tailer will not overstate in new product description considering the full return policy. In duopoly case, low quality e-tailer will not overstate while high quality e-tailer will do under certain conditions, and high quality e-tailer's overstatement will benefit both e-tailers under full return policy.

Design/methodology/approach – Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) has been applied for developing the forecasting model for product returns. A case of Indian mobile manufacturing company is discussed for the validation of this model. Survey conducted by the company and findings from previous research were used for data collection on probabilities and product life cycle. Findings – Product returns for their recycling are stochastic, random and uncertain. Therefore, to address the uncertainty, randomness and stochastic nature of product returns, GERT is very useful tool for forecasting product returns. Practical implications – GERT provides the visual picture of the reverse supply chain system and helps in determining the expected time of product returns in a much easier way but it requires probabilities of different flows and product life cycle. Both factors vary over a period, so require data update time to time before implementation. Originality/value – This model is developed by considering all possible flows of sold products from customer to their reuse, store or recycle or landfill. First time this type of real life flows have been considered and GERT has been applied for forecasting product returns. This model can be utilized by managers for better forecasting that will help them for effective reverse supply chain design. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",E-waste; Forecasting; GERT; Indian electronics industry; Reverse logistics,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978970585

One retailer is well established, offering a full-refund policy, while the other retailer is a new entrant into the market place. The new entrant retailer needs to decide whether to implement a full-refund policy or a no-refund policy, in order to compete with the well-established retailer under two games: Nash game and Stackelberg game.

In our model, an upstream vendor contracts with a downstream retailer. The vendor decides his consignment price charged to the retailer for each unit sold and his refund price for each returned item, and then the retailer sets her retail price for selling the product. The vendor gets paid based on net sold units and salvages unsold units as well as returned items in a secondary market. Under the framework, we study and compare two different consignment arrangements: the retailer/vendor manages consignment inventory (RMCI/VMCI) programs. To study the impact of return policy, we discuss a consignment contract without return policy as a benchmark. We show that whether or not the vendor offers a return policy, it is always beneficial for the channel to delegate the inventory decision to the vendor. We find that the vendor's return policy depends crucially on the salvage value of returns. If the product has no salvage value, the vendor's optimal decision is not to offer a return policy; otherwise, the vendor can gain more profit by offering a return policy when the salvage value turns out to be positive. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Several vendors alongside an original equipment manufacturer are available in provision of remanufacturing service. Each has its own queue. The stream of the product returns follow a stochastic process. A central controller is employed to decide to which vendor an incoming product is sent to avoid excessive queues in front of some vendors and idle servers in the others. We develop models and index-based heuristics to support the dynamic routing decisions so as to minimize the overall recovering costs. The product concerned exemplifies a short-life cycle due to, for example, technology advance. Long delay during the remanufacturing process will render a substantial deterioration of reselling prices. Hence, in the paper we contend that the cost incurred for remanufacturing a product should take explicit account of the impact of long delays in the lead time.

We consider the periodic-review inventory control problem for such a system where manufactured and remanufactured products are considered non-identical and have separate demand streams. Product returns and demand for both products are stochastic. A remanufactured item has a perceived lower value by the customer and thus has a lower price than a manufactured item. The manufacturer considers the use of a one-way product substitution strategy. When the remanufactured item inventory is out of stock, manufactured items are sold for the remanufactured item price (i.e. lower price) to the customers who demand remanufactured items. The problem is formulated as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process in order to find the optimal inventory policies with substitution and without substitution. The behavior of the system under product substitution strategy and its profitability is investigated through a numerical study based on real data from an automobile parts manufacturer. Results show that profitability is significantly affected by the remanufactured item price (pr) to manufacturing cost (cm) ratio. As pr/cm decreases, the increased profit provided by the substitution strategy over not substituting falls at an increasing rate. However, even when pr/cm ratio goes below 1 (i.e. unit profit by substitution is negative), substitution may still be profitable due to savings in lost sales. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This systematic review explores themes within eight qualitative studies of the experiences of asylum seekers and refugees who voluntarily return. It specifically focuses on the conditions that make reintegration back home most successful. There are three key findings: people need to be prepared for return, economically and psychologically; independent monitoring could protect returnees; and there are contradicting drivers between internal migration policies and return policies of EU host countries. Asylum seekers are ordinarily unable to work in the host country, which means they are unable to save or develop skills for return; these employment restrictions create dependency and corrode the resilience required for sustainable return. The findings of this review can be drawn upon as a model of discussion points between social workers and people considering return. It serves to highlight that return is not necessarily the end of the migration process for individuals. © The Author 2014.",Asylum seekers; Refugees; Reintegration; Return migration; Social work; Voluntary return,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902657716

We conduct a mean variance (MV) analysis of a fast fashion supply chain with returns policy. Different from the conventional newsvendor type products, fast fashion brands plan to have stock-out because it is a feature of fast fashion and can bring some benefit. Based on the fast fashion features, we build an analytical MV optimization model for a two-echelon fast fashion supply chain to address the following research questions. 1) What are the differences and similarities in the structural properties between the supply chains that carry fast fashion products and conventional newsvendor type products? 2) How do we optimize a fast fashion supply chain with multiple retailers under the MV framework? 3) Can a simple returns policy optimize (and 'coordinate') such a multiretailer supply chain? 4) How do individual retailers' degrees of risk aversion affect the achievability of coordination? 5) Can the above simple contract help coordinate the supply chain under information asymmetry? We propose a novel approach called 'negotiated space' in the analysis. We generate several important insights which include an interesting finding that a simple returns policy can be applied to coordinate the fast fashion supply chain even in the presence of multiple retailers. © 2013 IEEE.",Fast fashion product; mean variance analysis; supply chain coordination,Sales; Fast fashion product; Industrial practices; Information asymmetry; Mean-variance analysis; Multiple retailers; Optimization modeling; Research questions; Supply chain coordination; Supply chains,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890094095

Recently, these sectors have witnessed the growing popularity of peer-to-peer Web-based used goods markets as important transaction channels between buyers and sellers. Given that these two issues are critically linked from both supply and demand perspectives, in this paper we study the role that consumer valuation of used products plays in shaping a manufacturer's incentive to offer a returns policy option to a retailer when used goods might be devalued compared to new ones as a result of physical deterioration (or obsolescence). We do so through a two-period dyadic channel framework where the retailer faces uncertain demand for a durable product from a renewable set of customers who are impatient but forward looking. The manufacturer, on the other hand, needs to decide whether or not to offer a returns contract to the retailer. We first characterize the necessary and sufficient condition under which a returns contract is the equilibrium strategy as well as the corresponding channel decisions. Further analysis of this condition reveals that a higher consumer valuation of used products increases the likelihood of a returns contract being the equilibrium strategy. This result seems to be robust except when the potential demands for the two periods are quite deterministic and uncorrelated. However, it contradicts the burgeoning managerial trend to replace returns contracts with price-only ones in sectors where used goods are valued relatively highly by the consumers. We also discuss how used goods markets affect the equilibrium channel decisions as well as how demand uncertainty and logistics costs associated with returns influence the equilibrium contracting strategy. © 2013 INFORMS.",Decentralized channel; Demand correlation; Returns policy; Stochastic demand; Used goods,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880932902

This paper reports on the collection, testing, and classification of 189 discarded microwave ovens. We find that most had only minor, if any, issues and almost all were suitable for reuse and/or remanufacturing. It was also documented, in face-to-face interviews with 82 persons discarding microwaves, that consumers have little knowledge of disposal routes for end-of-life products other than public recycling facilities, and that a large proportion of consumers discarding microwaves intended to buy a similar product, calling into question the widely-held belief that e-waste is always driven by a desire for the latest technology. Based on these results, it is not unreasonable to argue that, for microwave ovens, the major impediments to reuse are neither the quality of discarded products nor the cost of electrical spare parts, but rather current product design and the incipiency of the market for second hand items. Using this information, minor changes in design that would significantly improve re-usability are proposed to OEMs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A threshold policy is considered to control the admission of the product returns and its effect on the trade-off between excessive inventory and stock out. We study how the control parameters in these strategies relate to the average inventory level and stock out level of the remanufacturable modules. Starting with a single quality grade problem, we extend the analysis to a multiple quality grade problem and derive exact expression of the system performance measures as function of the control parameters.

The most straightforward way to develop a pharmacogenetically targeted drug is to identify a functionally important genetic variant in the drug's target(s), or in a target modifier. There are two general ways to detect such genetic variation, the candidate gene variant hypothesis testing approach, and genome wide scanning ""hypothesis free"" methods. In order to impact drug development either approach needs to be implemented early in the drug development process, with the candidate strategy having the advantage that it can be introduced earlier, during preclinical development. Contrary to conventional wisdom, a pharmacogenetic approach does not increase the overall efficiency of drug development, because the required additional genetic and biologic function discovery work will be layered onto standard regulatory steps. However, identification of a hyper-responsive subpopulation by a genetic biomarker does increase the chance of success in Phase 3, which may lower the cost of pivotal trials. Perhaps most importantly from a commercial standpoint, pharmacogenetics use patents, typically submitted relatively late in the development process, can greatly extend a drug's exclusivity period. This will recoup the extra cost inherent to pharmacogenetic drug development, and increase the product's return on investment by providing a longer period for branded exclusivity. Most importantly, pharmacogenetic targeting will result in a therapeutic agent with a greater therapeutic index and a better pharmacoeconomic profile than would be possible with pan-genetic, entire cohort positioning. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Cardiovascular drugs; Drug development; Pharmacogenetics; Pharmacogenomics,Drug Design; Heart Failure; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Stroke Volume; aldosterone antagonist; angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; bucindolol; cardiovascular agent; carvedilol; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; endothelin 1; isosorbide dinitrate; metoprolol; DNA polymorphism; drug development; drug targeting; genetic variability; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; personalized medicine; pharmacogenetics; priority journal; review,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857363880

In this paper, we address the inventory management issue in closed-loop supply chains, and develop deterministic and stochastic models for a two-echelon system with correlated demands and returns under generalized cost structures. In particular, we address the following questions - Do closed-loop supply chains cost more than traditional forward supply chains? Does a higher rate of return always translate into lower demand variability and hence lower expected costs? What is the relationship between expected costs and correlations between demands and returns? Models developed and numerical examples shown in the paper reveal that although a higher rate of return and a higher correlation between demand and return reduce the variability of net demand, it may not necessarily lead to cost savings; rather the movement of costs will depend on the values of system parameters. We also quantify the cost savings in case the actual demand and return information is available at the time of decision-making.

The issues examined here consist of the nature and influence of such factors as ""buying experience"", ""perceived risk"", and ""return frequency"". The aim of this paper is to analyse four groups of returners (""heavy returners"", ""medium returners"", ""light returners"", and ""occasional returners""). Design/methodology/approach: This paper details an empirical study of return behaviour based on a field survey that was conducted specifically focusing on the apparel category. Exploratory factor analyses and analyses of variance (ANOVA) have been employed to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: Results show that there exist different reasons for returns among the four groups of returners. In particular, they differ in their initial shopping motivation for mail order purchases, their group-specific reasons for product returns, and also in their spending patterns. Research limitations/implications: These are discussed within the body of the paper. Practical implications: A number of meaningful implications for mail-order firms are developed from the empirical findings. While product returners have been thought to be an amorphous category (akin to a ""black box"") in the past, this paper highlights the disparate motives for making returns. Specific prescriptions are provided regarding the management of product description, consumer return policy, and the handling of consumer perceived risk. Originality/value: This paper contributes toward the evolving literature of consumer return behaviour in the context of distance purchasing and also by taking into consideration the heterogeneity of return groups. It looks at the characteristics of the return groups and how they differ in their prior motives of making their purchase decisions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Apparel; Consumer behaviour; Mail order industry; Retailing; Return behaviour; Shopping motivation,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873440043

Because environmental issues are important, industries actively seek ways in which to reduce their environmental footprint. One effective method is through the use of reverse logistics. Reverse logistics is the concept of reusing used products in order to reduce wastes and to increase an industry's environmental performance and resulting profits. Stock selection, transportation, centralized collection, data collection, refurbishing, and remanufacturing are some of the more commonly utilized reverse logistic operations. An effective reverse logistics network is essential for increasing the flow of goods from customers to producers. The objective of this paper is to develop a multi-echelon reverse logistics network for product returns to minimize the total reverse logistics cost, which consists of renting, inventory carrying, material handling, setup, and shipping costs. Industries need to give more attention to the task of collecting used products from customers and establishing collection facilities. In this study, a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed to find out the number and location of initial collection points and centralized return centers required for an effective return and collection system, and also the maximum holding time (collection frequency) for aggregation of small volumes of returned products into large shipments. Two solution approaches, namely genetic algorithm and artificial immune system, are implemented and compared. The usefulness of the proposed model and algorithm are demonstrated via an illustrative example. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial immune system (AIS); Genetic algorithm (GA); Location-allocation; Reverse logistics,Data acquisition; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Genetic algorithms; Immune system; Integer programming; Materials handling; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Ships; Transportation; Artificial Immune System; Environmental footprints; Environmental legislations; Environmental performance; Location allocation; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Reverse logistics; Reverse logistics network; attention; genetic algorithm; immune system; materials handling; model; profit; shipping; Logistics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027944368

This situation is typical of most remanufacturing environment, where inputs are product returns (also called cores). Remanufacturing costs increase as the quality level decreases and any unused cores may be salvaged at a value that increases with their quality level. The aim of this paper is to develop a goal programming (GP) formulation within imprecise goals and inputs quality of product returns where the concept of satisfaction function will be utilised to introduce explicitly the manger's preferences into the remanufacturing aggregate planning model. In order to verify our proposed model, a numerical example is described to generate the best satisfying aggregate plan.

All defective items are returned to the supplier in next delivery. After receipt of the returned items, the supplier will classify them into two types: items that still have some worth and waste items. For those items that still have some worth, the supplier will offer customers a discount in order to minimize losses arising from these defective items. The supplier needs to pay a disposal fee for those items classified as waste items. Shortages are allowed and are fully backlogged. To encourage sales the supplier offers trade credit to the retailer. A two-echelon inventory model is established, and the decision variables include: replenishment cycle time, the time taken to run out of stock and the number of lots delivered from the supplier to the retailer. An algorithm is developed to determine the optimal supply chain strategy and numerical examples are provided to show the solution procedure.

The objective is to facilitate the decision-making when the management faces the dilemma of implementing either a strategy of early large-scale investments to benefit from economies of scale and capacity readiness, or a flexible strategy of low volume but more frequent capacity expansions. We consider a CLSC with two sequential product-types. We study the system's response in terms of transient flows, actual/desired capacity level, capacity expansions/contractions and total supply chain profit, employing a simulation-based system dynamics optimization approach. Extensive numerical investigation covers a broad range of real-world remanufacturable products under alternative scenarios in relation to the market preference over product-types. The key findings propose flexible policies as improved alternatives to large-scale capacity expansions/contractions in terms of adaptability to the actual pattern of end-of-use product returns and involved risk in the investments' turnover. Flexible policies are also proposed as practices to avoid overcapacity phenomena in collection and remanufacturing capacity and as robust policies to product demand. Their implementation is revealed to be even more important for the case of remanufacturing, when a high capacity acquisition unit-cost ratio (remanufacturing/collection) is coupled with strong economies of scale. Finally, results under different information sharing structures show changes in remanufacturing policies, thus justifying the importance of coordination between the decision-maker and the distributor. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This can be explained by both the inherent violence of this process, which raises widespread public opposition, and by the geopolitical difficulties it raises, as there must be agreement of both countries concerned. In recent years these problems appear to have been partially overcome and since 2005 a 'deportation turn' is evident across the European Union as deportations increase. This paper focuses on the international dimension to this increase, following work investigating deportation as an essentially biopolitical process of international governance of populations. This approach is developed in an analysis of the geopolitical impacts of that management process. The paper uses empirical research with Sri Lankan migrants who left the UK either as a result of force or voluntary returns policies to explain this development. It identifies the changing strategy of the deportation process, particularly recent attention to the negotiation of bilateral and multilateral readmission agreements and the role of international organisations as mediators as key contributions to an explanation for the rise in deportations. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Sri Lanka; United Kingdom; democracy; European Union; forced migration; geopolitics; immigration,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860895646

It is a new way to enhance company competitiveness. In particular, reverse logistics aims to optimize reverse product flows to limit residual waste. One of the most critical problems in the reverse logistics field is the design of reverse logistic networks. The purpose of this work is to propose a comprehensive generic model that can help decision makers to design networks that cover remanufacturing activities. This model also aims to help devise strategies for the pricing of used and remanufactured products. More precisely a dynamic, multi-commodity, two-level capacitated facility-location problem for the green design of reverse logistic networks is presented. Therefore, both economic and ecological costs of reverse logistic activities are taken into account to help minimize the damages of the reverse supply chain on the environment. Last, in order to better reflect real cases, this model includes fundamental features of reverse logistics that have been overlooked in the literature, namely, uncertainty in product returns, time dependency of the decision variables, capacity constraints, and the possibility of treating multiple classes of products at one time. © KEDGE BS.",Dynamic facility location; Green supply chain design; Multi-commodity; Remanufacturing activities; Reverse logistics; Uncertain returns,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897083108

We first trace the trajectory of Union competences over readmissions from implicit to shared. We then provide a brief overview of European Union's readmission agreements discussing their scope and content in relation to human rights guarantees and the third-country nationals' clause. Based on a case study of the French agreements on joint management of immigration flows and partnership development we test whether these agreements are better placed to deal with readmission of third-country nationals than those of the European Union despite a weak human rights record. We find that the French agreements on joint management of immigration flows and partnership development do not compare to European Union's readmission agreements, because of the broader issue linkages in particular between labour market access and readmission obligations. On that basis we find against a parallelism which might establish an exclusive Union competence over readmission. Yet, the Commission and Council argue that the conclusion of an European Union's readmission agreement stands proof, together with the European Union Returns Directive of the Union's occupying the field, so that Member States are precluded from bilateral action. Finally, European Union's mobility partnerships, which increasingly require the conclusion of an European Union's readmission agreement, may strengthen arguments in favour of exclusivity, based on the principles of parallelism and subsidiarity. © Author(s) [2012].

More industries are adopting it as a strategic tool to achieve sustainable profitability, to avoid wastage, to benefit the customer relationship, and to improve their image by greening the supply chain. However, mostly, RL is a complex process. For that reason, many companies decide to outsource its implementation and management in order to avoid dealing with its barriers and impediments. In this sense, the objective of this paper is to identify the most important drivers and barriers that enable or impede RL development in Brazil. For that, a systematic content analysis approach was adopted in order to find the most cited drivers for RL. Secondly, a case-based research was conducted in a Reverse Logistics Service Provider (RLSP) located in Southern Brazil. This aimed at determining the main RL barriers in order to compare them to the data gathered from the literature. Multiple sources of evidence have been used, enabling triangulation data analysis and improving data validity. The empirical results indicate that five significant barriers hinder the RL development: (1) high taxation on recyclable materials; (2) dispersion of collecting points for end of life products and the lack of Brazilian consumer awareness of environmentally friendly disposal options; (3) lack of shared responsibility in the reverse supply chain; (4) presence of many parties in the return flow increases its costs; and (5) high RL costs. Both practitioners and academics might find this study useful, as it outlines the Brazilian barriers for RL, the largest Latin America economy. In addition, this work is built on the recent research in RL.

We also provide an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal base-stock level. For the second system, demands and returns are strongly correlated: a satisfied demand induces a product return after a stochastic return lead-time, with a certain probability. When the return lead-time is null, we extend the results obtained for the first system. When the return lead-time is positive, the optimal control problem is more complex and we do not prove that the optimal policy is of base-stock type. However, we provide a framework to analyse base-stock policies. Finally, we carry out a numerical study on many scenarios to investigate the impact of ignoring dependency between demands and returns.

The analysis first addresses the recent changes in the regime for the protection of migrants brought about by the adoption of new national legal provisions to check the conformity of Italian legislation with the Directive, seeking to identify the challenges and the practical problems that Italy is facing in transposing this instrument to the national level. The analysis will aim to identify jurisprudence issuing from regional and national bodies, which is advancing the standards of the treatment of unauthorised migrants in the context of hostile domestic law and political rhetoric, applying the doctrine of "" direct effect"" of European Union law. The article also explores the role of jurisprudence in providing effective protection of the fundamental rights of irregular migrants once present in a host State, limiting the absolute discretion of States.

We define quality risk as the possibility of product misfit, defect, or unconformity with the consumers' perception. These notions of quality risks differ in return policy restriction, residual values, and whether it is possible to unambiguously reduce the probability of mismatch. Using a stylized two-segment market setting, we demonstrate that consumer returns are offered only when the high-segment consumers incur a higher hassle cost, and both the quality risk and the valuation of the low segment are moderate. Moreover, it is possible to wisely design the returns policy that eliminates all inappropriate returns. Furthermore, the seller with a high-quality risk may offer a refund that exceeds the selling price, which provides a theoretical ground and specific operating regime for the satisfaction guaranteed policy used in some e-tailers. In contrast, when the quality risk is relatively low, further improvement on mitigating the quality risk may not necessarily benefit the seller. Finally, we observe that the restocking fee may be non-monotonic in product quality; thus, a more generous returns policy does not necessarily indicate a lower quality risk. © 2011 Production and Operations Management Society.",consumer returns; quality risk; restocking fees; satisfaction guaranteed,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860855356

Semiconductor firms face rapid product obsolescence, declining prices over product life cycles, and unexpected industry downturns, which naturally lead to product return and pricing adjustment uncertainties.

Within the high-tech industry, Reverse Logistics (RL) in the form of end-of-life, stock balancing, defective/warranty, recycle, and re-use product returns, is particularly important owing to the complexity and dependency that exist throughout the extended supply chain in order to maintain brand loyalty and customer satisfaction (source, OEM vendors and end customers alike). RL is fast becoming a strategy to acquire an organisational competitive advantage, making the quest to exploit such a function a premeditated decision. The introduction of Third-Party Logistics (3PL) providers has become a necessity for those supply-chain operations where issues of cost and risk mitigation need to be balanced with agility and responsiveness. This paper develops a conceptual framework of the factors influencing Reverse 3PL based upon Information Systems (IS) and associated Resource Commitment (RC) factors. The framework is then tested using a mixed-method research based approach using a 3PL organisation based in Thailand. The research findings reveal that among the proposed factors, IS- and RC-based operating performance, resource cost-effectiveness and RC (at financial, managerial and technological levels in the firm) were deemed to have a stronger positive relationship and input into reverse 3PL operations for the firm in context. The model is validated using the techniques of System Dynamics and Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",3PL; Information Systems; Resource Commitment; Reverse logistics; Supply chain,Competition; Customer satisfaction; Industry; Information systems; Supply chains; 3PL; Brand loyalty; Cognitive mapping; Competitive advantage; Conceptual frameworks; Cycle time; End customers; End-of-life; High-tech industries; Logistics operations; Multiechelon; Operating performance; Product returns; Resource commitment; Reverse logistics; Risk mitigation; System Dynamics; Technological level; Thailand; Third-party logistics (3PL) providers; Outsourcing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864398293

The accurate forecasting of product returns is important for procurement decisions, production planning, and inventory and disposal management in such remanufacturing operations. In this study, we consider a manufacturer that also acts as a remanufacturer, and develop a generalized forecasting approach to determine the distribution of the returns of used products, as well as integrate it with an inventory model to enable production planning and control. We compare our forecasting approach to previous models and show that our approach is more consistent with continuous time, provides accurate estimates when the return lags are exponential in nature, and results in fewer units being held in inventory on average. The analysis revealed that these gains in accuracy resulted in the most cost savings when demand volumes for remanufactured products were high compared to the volume of returned products. Such situations require the frequent acquisition of cores to meet demand. The results show that significant cost savings can be achieved by using the proposed approach for sourcing product returns. © 2012 The Authors.

The increasing number of electronic retailing and catalogue sales fulfil the requirement of home shopping. More liberal return policies have been introduced to protect customers' buying rights and at the same time generate more sales. A growing number of environmental regulations are created which involve a wide range of products. All of these circumstances contribute to the reverse flow of products which require manufacturing organisations to strategically manage and deal with the return flows. Reverse supply chains or reverse logistics have attracted the attention of many academics and practitioners and one of the important field studies in this area is of Supply Chain Management. To contribute to the field, this research is purposely carried out to study the performance measurement in reverse supply chains. Reverse logistics networks may be classified into several categories depending on the source of the reverse flow. This research will focus on customer and distribution return flows. The research is significant because there is a gap in the literature and it could help to give companies guidance in managing their reverse supply chains better. Case studies on five companies which include manufacturers and retailers in the UK provide empirical evidence for their practice of performance measurement in reverse supply chains. The research investigates the selection of strategic objectives for reverse supply chains and the impact of product returns' characteristics and the choice of product returns disposition channels. Learning from the performance measurement in a reverse supply chain, the paper enlisted five performance attributes which is part of a three-level performance measurement framework model designed for reverse and closed-loop supply chains. This framework model provides the decision makers with a formal and systematic approach to select strategic objectives and towards the use of meaningful performance attributes and performance metrics. Subsequently, it offers a practical approach to the decision maker to perform and manage the reverse supply chain more effectively.",Closed-loop supply chain; Performance attributes; Performance metrics; Reverse supply chain,Decision making; Environmental regulations; Life cycle; Logistics; Manufacture; Sales; Supply chain management; Closed-loop supply chain; Manufacturing organisations; Performance attributes; Performance measurement frameworks; Performance measurements; Performance metrics; Reverse logistics network; Reverse supply chains; Chains,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929377545

In developing countries like India, pharmacists often dispense 'prescription-only' drugs, like antibiotics, to patients who do not have a prescription. Not much data is available regarding detailed information on behaviour of antibiotic use by community pharmacists which is of particular significance to develop a suitable and sustainable intervention programme to promote rational use of antibiotics. A qualitative study was conducted to understand the dispensing practices and behaviour of community pharmacists to develop policy interventions that would improve the use of antibiotics at the community level. Methods: Focus group discussions (FGDs) were held for five municipal wards of Delhi with retail pharmacists, public sector pharmacists and the office bearers of pharmacists' associations. Data on antibiotic use and resistance were collected earlier from these five wards. FGDs (n = 3 with 40 pharmacists) were analysed through grounded theory. Results and Discussion: Four broad themes identified were as follows: prescribing and dispensing behaviour; commercial interests; advisory role; and intervention strategies for rational use of antibiotics. FGDs with pharmacists working in the public sector revealed that, besides the factors listed above, overstock and near-expiry, and under-supply of antibiotics promoted antibiotic misuse. Suggestions for interventions from pharmacists were the following: (i) education to increase awareness of rational use and resistance to antibiotics; (ii) involving pharmacists as partners for creating awareness among communities for rational use and resistance to antibiotics; (iii) developing an easy return policy for near-expiry antibiotics in public sector facilities; and (iv) motivating and showing appreciation for community pharmacists who participate in intervention programmes. What is new and Conclusions: Inappropriate antibiotic dispensing and use owing to commercial interests and lack of knowledge about the rational use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance were the main findings of this in-depth qualitative study. Community pharmacists were willing to participate in educational programme aimed at improving use of antibiotics. Such programmes should be initiated within a multidisciplinary framework including doctors, pharmacists, social scientists, government agencies and non-profit organizations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",antibiotic resistance; antibiotic use; community pharmacists; dispensing practices; India; rational use of antibiotics,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Community Pharmacy Services; Crime; Developing Countries; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Education, Pharmacy; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Misuse; Humans; India; Nonprescription Drugs; Patient Education as Topic; Pharmacists; Prescription Drugs; Professional Role; Qualitative Research; Self Medication; Societies, Pharmaceutical; Urban Population; antibiotic agent; cotrimoxazole; prescription drug; allied health education; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic therapy; article; developing country; drug use; education program; human; India; pharmacist; pharmacist attitude; prescription; qualitative research",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861331657

It is assumed that the manufacturer will either sell the items to the vendor outright or offer the items to the vendor with return policy. In the latter case, the manufacturer buys back from the vendor the unsold items at the end of the selling season. This study considers one item with budget constraints. The vendor has the option of purchasing the goods outright, obtaining the goods with return policy, or a combination of both. By using Kuhn-Tucker Conditions and inductive method, our analysis proposes an optimal inventory policy theorem. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the vendor should replenish the items with return policy under limited budget and changing prices. We show that there exists a set of conditions under which the vendor's optimal strategy will change based on the amount of available budget for product procurement. If the purchase price with return policy is greater than the price of outright purchase and the vendor has a small amount of available budget, only outright purchase will be optimal. However, if the budget reaches a certain threshold amount, mixed strategies where items are obtained by outright purchase and with return policy are used. We also show that when the purchase price with return policy is not greater than the outright purchase, the vendor will only obtain the items with return policy. © 2012 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.",Kuhn-Tucker conditions; Ordering policy; Return policy,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896882830

The authors compare the normative assumptions about customers that underlie equity-based return shipping policies with the more realistic, positivist expectations as predicted by attribution, equity, and regret theories. Two longitudinal field studies over four years using two surveys and actual customer spending data indicate that retailer confidence in those normative assumptions is unjustified. Contrary to retailer assumptions, neither the positive consequences of free returns nor the negative consequences of fee returns were reversed when customer perceptions of fairness were taken into account. Depending on the locus and extent of blame, customers who paid for their own return decreased their postreturn spending at that retailer 75%-100% by the end of two years. In contrast, returns that were free to the consumer resulted in postreturn customer spending that was 158%-457% of prereturn spending.

One of the first and important decisions for greening a supply chain is to design supply chain networks while considering environmental factors. In this study, a multiproduct post-sales reverse logistics network operated by a third party logistics service provider is considered, which consists of collection centers, repair facilities, production plants, and disposal centers. It is assumed that amount of products returns from customers are uncertain parameters varying in intervals with known nominal and shift values. A bi-objective robust mixed integer linear programming model is presented for minimizing network design costs as well as minimizing total weighted tardiness of returning products to collection centers. Various decisions including location of repair facilities, allocation of repair equipments to facilities, and material flows are simultaneously considered.

The model is intended to identify the need of placing a manufacturing/purchasing order, to avoid the occurrence of stock-out situations. We then formulate a total cost minimisation problem, to derive the optimal return policy, this latter being a financial incentive paid to customers to increase the flow of returned items. The model developed is investigated through simulations, in order to assess the effect of stochasticity (of demand, return fraction and return delay) on the optimal return policy of the system; then, it is validated through a case study, to derive indications concerning its practical application in real cases.

We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal control policy. In particular, we show that the optimal reassembly and substitution follow a state-dependent threshold-based control policy. We also establish the structural properties of the thresholds.

Options include remanufacturing, materials recycling, and dismantling for spare parts. The answer to this question depends on the firm’s objectives and environment. In many industries, remanufacturing is more profitable than dismantling for spare parts, which is more profitable than materials recycling. Recycling may or may not be profitable; and dismantling for spare parts may not be an option if the firm is not an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). There may be uncertainty in demand for remanufactured products and/or the condition of returned products. We review here different decision support models for addressing this problem, and identify the conditions in which one approach is preferred over the other. We conclude with a quick review of the product (return) acquisition problem, which is related to the disposition problem, and that concerns the appropriate number of product returns to acquire in order to support the firm’s closed-loop supply chain operations. © Springer Science+Business Media NewYork 2012.",Closed-loop supply chains; Product disposition; Production planning; Remanufacturing,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958981230

The manufacturer sells product to customer through traditional channel and Internet channel respectively. According to the preference of customer, we group the product market into three parts, which is more close to the reality. The manufacturer forecasts the demand for three groups, but the actual demand is less than his expectation. We introduce a full-refund return policy and service value into model to investigate the performance of supply chain. In order to maximize their profits, manufacturer and retailer should make decisions on the pricing strategies. Through numerical simulations, we find that the return policy can effectively reduce the risk which is caused by the demand uncertainty. And the service value has two sides, which should be paying more attention on. We also derive several conclusions on the optimal sale strategy for the manufacturer and retailer in this study. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.",Demand uncertainty; Dual-channel; Return policy; Service value,Manufacture; Supply chains; Demand uncertainty; Dual channel; Dual channel supply chain; Internet channels; Pricing strategy; Return policy; Sale strategies; Service values; Sales,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891471671

Each stage is a stocking point holding some form of inventory (e.g.; raw materials, subassemblies, product returns or finished products) that after a suitable transformation can satisfy demand. Stocking decisions are made before demand occurs. Unsatisfied demands are lost. The revenue, salvage value, ordering, transformation, and lost sales costs are proportional. There are fixed costs for utilizing stages for stock storage. The objective is to maximize the probability of achieving a given target profit level. We prove the existence of optimal stocking decisions where at most three stages receive nonzero stocks. We also characterize properties of the optimal stocking decisions and provide an O( N3) algorithm for their computation. For the special case where all fixed costs are zero, the stages utilized do not depend on the demand distribution or the target level, and one can find optimal stocking decisions by performing a simple O( N2) search and solving a single-variable optimization problem. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In a highly competitive environment, the service level is an important criterion for reverse logistics network design. However, most previous studies about product returns only focused on the total cost of the reverse logistics and neglected the service level. To help a manufacturer of electronic products provide quality postsale repair service for their consumer, this paper proposes a multiobjective reverse logistics network optimisation model that considers the objectives of the cost, the total tardiness of the cycle time, and the coverage of customer zones. The Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed for solving this multiobjective optimisation model. To evaluate the performance of NSGA-II, a genetic algorithm based on weighted sum approach and Multiobjective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) are also applied. The performance of these three heuristic algorithms is compared using numerical examples. The computational results show that NSGA-II outperforms MOSA and the genetic algorithm based on weighted sum approach. Furthermore, the key parameters of the model are tested, and some conclusions are drawn. © 2012 Shuang Li et al.",,Costs; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Simulated annealing; Competitive environment; Computational results; Cycle time; Electronic product; Key parameters; Multi objective; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; NSGA-II; Numerical example; Product returns; Repair services; Reverse logistics; Reverse logistics network; Reverse logistics network design; Service levels; Total tardiness; Used product; Weighted Sum; Logistics,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869057557

However, in today's world, MBGs are ubiquitous among major retailers, even when the likelihood of product return varies greatly between them. To understand this phenomenon, we explore a competitive environment between high- and low-quality retailers where consumers are fully informed and risk neutral, and retailers realize a salvage value for returned products. When MBGs are profitable, under continuous demand it is Nash equilibrium for both retailers to offer MBGs, and the low-quality retailer gains while the high-quality retailer loses relative to when MBGs are not offered. In contrast, if demand is lumpy, retailers can act monopolistically over their respective market segments, allowing both retailers to gain from MBGs, although the low-quality retailer still gains more. © 2012 INFORMS.",Competitive Strategy; Marketing; Product Policy; Retailing And Wholesaling,Marketing; Profitability; Competitive environment; Competitive strategy; Continuous demand; High quality; Low qualities; Market segment; Nash equilibria; Product policy; Product returns; Retailing And Wholesaling; Signaling theory; Sales,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865446406

The methodology uses two approaches, namely central tendency approach and extreme point approach, and is developed for the consumer electronics industry. The methodology presented here is based on the return reason codes (RC). The incoming returns are split into different categories using reason codes. These reason codes are further analyzed to forecast returns. The computation part of this model uses a combination of two approaches, namely extreme point approach and central tendency approach. Both the approaches are used separately for separate types of reason codes and then results are added together. The extreme point approach is based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a first step combined with a linear regression while central tendency approach uses a moving average. For certain type of returns, DEA evaluates relative ranks of products using single input and multiple outputs. Once this is completed, linear regression defines a correlation between relative rank (predictor variable) and return quantity (response variable). For the remaining type of returns the authors use a moving average of percent returns to estimate the central tendency. Reason codes and consumer behavior in combination with statistical methods can be used to forecast product returns. Consumer electronics retailers and manufacturers can effectively use this methodology to forecast product returns. This methodology effectively addresses and covers different product return scenarios. This research paper shows the new way of forecasting product returns i.e. reason codes based forecasting by combining two approaches, namely extreme point approach and central tendency approach. Also, it shows a new way of translating the consumer behavior into meaningful data; that data can be fed to a model to forecast product returns. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Electrical goods; Electronics industry; Forecasting; Reverse logistics,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859902143

In this paper, the authors aim to discuss and compare the manufacturer's contracting options when the retailer faces a traditional newsvendor problem with a fixed retail price: a wholesale price only contract, a wholesale price discount contract, a returns policy contract, and a returns policy with the wholesale price discount contract. The paper also aims to examine how these contracting options affect decisions of the manufacturer and the retailer, as well as the supply chain efficiency. Models are developed based on the manufacturer's four contracting options. The manufacturer's optimal wholesale prices have been obtained. The ordering decisions of the retailer are discussed in each of the manufacturer's four contracting options. The paper also uses numerical examples to illustrate the author's managerial insights and results. As compared to the wholesale price only contract, it is found that implementing a wholesale price discount policy effectively encourages the retailer to order more product and enhances the retailer's profit at the expense of lowering the manufacturer's profit. It is also found that when the manufacturer offers a returns policy and if this policy cannot enhance the retailer's profit, a returns policy with the wholesale price discount contract can lead to a win-win situation for both the manufacturer and the retailer. The research provides managerial insights on how different contracts affect decisions and efficiency of the supply chain. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Contracts; Demand management; Demand uncertainty; Newsvendor problem; Returns policy; Supply and demand; Supply chain management; Wholesale price discount,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939632074

In the online marketplace, one area of growing interest is that of product returns. Though commonly viewed as a cost center from an operations perspective, operations' actions have the potential to strongly influence future customer buying behavior in several ways. Using an archival database of actual purchase and returns history provided by a moderately sized online retailer, this study examines the relationship between a customer's experience of product returns, and subsequent shopping behavior. Employing transaction cost, consumer risk, and procedural justice theories, we demonstrate that the returns management process, rather than being regarded as an afterthought to the production and deployment of goods, can significantly and positively influence repurchase behavior. Additionally, we provide evidence that certain customers should be considered for prioritization in the returns process. We suggest ways through which operations managers can take care in discharging their responsibilities in this area - to make returns processing more than simply a ""necessary cost of doing business"" rather, using it to their advantage in engendering repeat and increased purchase behavior. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: The study was designed as a randomised controlled experiment with a random sample strategy. Among the 192,482 Swedish customers who had made an order at nelly.com during the previous 12 months and were to receive the quarterly nelly.com newsletter in November 2010 by e-mail, 4,000 were randomly selected and randomised into four groups of 1,000 in each group. Findings: The experiment revealed certain purchase and return patterns that support the conclusion that (r)e-tail borrowing behaviour exists in fashion e-commerce. Evidence was also found that lenient delivery and returns policies seem to reinforce (r)e-tail borrowing behaviour, albeit not always in expected ways. Practical implications: Differences in delivery and return policies seem to impact consumer purchase and return behaviour differently depending on the type of item. Therefore a more differentiated view of how to apply them is suggested. Offering the same delivery and return policies to all types of customers and products is generally not optimal with respect to profitability. Originality/value: The paper illustrates the need to consider both delivery and returns policies together with customer and product categories simultaneously when applying them in an e-commerce context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Consumer behaviour; Decision making; E-commerce; E-tail borrowing; Experimental study; Retail borrowing; Returns; Sweden,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869011749

A detailed risk simulation of price formation in the Great Britain wholesale power market is used to show that the increasing replacement of fossil facilities with wind, ceteris paribus, may cause a deterioration of the financial risk-return performance metrics for incremental investments. Low-carbon investments appear to be high risk, low return, and as such may require a progressively higher level of support over time than envisaged by the conventional degression trajectories. The increasing riskiness of the wholesale market will to some extent offset the benefits of lower capital costs and operational efficiencies if investors need to satisfy cautious debt coverage ratios alongside positive expected returns. This increased risk is additional to the well-known 'merit order effect' of low-carbon investments progressively depressing wholesale prices and hence their expected investment returns. Policy relevance Policy support for renewable technologies such as wind is usually based upon levelized costs and is expected to reduce over time as capital costs and operational efficiencies improve. However, levelized costs do not take full account of the risk aversion that investors may have in practice. Expected policy support reductions may be moderated to some extent by the increased financial performance risk that intermittent technologies bring to the power market. The annual risk-return profiles for incremental investments deteriorate for all technologies as wind replaces fossil fuels. This extra risk premium will need to be incorporated into evaluating policy incentives for new investments in a decarbonizing power market. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",coal; financing; incentives; investment; risk; wind power,United Kingdom; coal; environmental policy; finance; incentive; investment; renewable resource; risk factor; sustainable development; trajectory; wind power,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873279085

This emphasis typically ignores the potential of in-store logistics operations in the creation of customer value. A major objective of retail customers is to navigate the retail servicescape in an efficient, convenient, enjoyable and effective manner. In-store logistics operations largely determine how and to what extent the customer may achieve this objective. However, customer-perceived indicators of in-store logistics performance, such as product returns, order information, opening hours, and product availability and accessibility, have been largely ignored in research on retail service. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of in-store logistics in determining customer outcomes such as store image, satisfaction and loyalty intentions. A model is developed based on extant research in the areas of logistics service quality, service logic, store image, and customer loyalty. To test the plausibility of the model, 200 supermarket customers were surveyed in an exploratory field study. Data were analyzed by means of structural equation modeling in SmartPLS. Results show that customers may derive a substantial share of their satisfaction from interactions with in-store logistics operations. Customer-perceived performance of these operations – an important element of the retail servicescape – influences customer satisfaction directly, but also through its influence on store image. In-store logistics dimensions were identified based on exploratory research. A more structured, theory-driven approach, might yield further insight. Explained variance levels in the outcome variables point at unobserved influences. Future research into the drivers of retail experience satisfaction could further complete the picture.

This variability in the stream of returned end-of-life (EOL) products makes it difficult to plan for remanufacturing facility materials, equipment, and human resource requirements. The aim of this research is to tackle the uncertainty associated with the quantity of received used products. A stochastic programming model for waste stream acquisition systems (as opposed to market-driven systems) is introduced. The model considers the quantity of returned product as an uncertain parameter and determines to what extent the product should be disassembled and what is the best EOL option for each subassembly. The stochastic model is defined in a form of chance constrained programming and is then converted to a mixed integer linear programming. An example is provided to illustrate the application of the model for an uncertain stream of PCs (minus monitor and keyboard) received in a PC refurbishing company. The remanufacturer must then decide which proportion of disassembled modules should be processed given specific remanufacturing options. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.",,Commerce; Computer programming; Microcomputers; Stochastic programming; Wastes; Acquisition systems; Chance-constrained programming; Consumer interests; Degree of uncertainty; e-Waste; End-of-life; End-of-life electronics; Environmental concerns; Green products; Legislative requirements; Mixed integer linear programming; Product returns; Resource requirements; Stochastic programming model; Uncertain parameters; Used product; Waste stream; Electronic equipment,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867028202

Employing functional analysis, we prove the existence of the optimal replenishment policies for the discounted-cost and average-cost problems when demand, returns, and cost functions are of polynomial growth. Our model generalizes literature results by integrating Markovian demand, Markovian returns, and positive replenishment lead times. In particular, the optimality of the reorder point, order-up-to policies is proved when the order cost consists of fixed setup and proportional cost components and the inventory surplus cost is convex. We then make model extensions to include different cost components and to differentiate returned products from new ones. Finally, we derive managerial insights for running integrated closed-loop supply chains. At the aggregate level, returns reduce effective demand while many structural characteristics of inventory models are intact. A simple heuristic for managing systems with returns is to still utilize literature results without returns, but effective demand is lower than customer demand. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Dynamic programming; Inventory control; Polynomial growth functions; Reverse logistics,Cost benefit analysis; Cost functions; Dynamic programming; Inventory control; Logistics; Supply chains; Cost components; Customer demands; Growth functions; Inventory systems; Markov Decision Processes; Markovian; Polynomial growth function; Polynomial growths; Product returns; Reverse logistics; Markov processes,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876424535

To deal with such a vague return problem, businesses must improve their information transparency in order to administrate the product return behaviour of their end users. This study proposes an intelligent return administration expert system (iRAES) to provide product return forecasting and decision support for returned product administration. The iRAES consists of two intelligent agents that adopt a hybrid data mining algorithm. The return diagnosis agent generates different alarms for certain types of product return, based on forecasts of the return possibility. The return recommender agent is implemented on the basis of case-based reasoning, and provides the return centre clerk with a recommendation for returned product administration. We present a 3C-iShop scenario to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the iRAES architecture. Our experiments identify a particularly interesting return, for which iRAES generates a recommendation for returned product administration. On average, iRAES decreases the effort required to generate a recommendation by 70% compared to previous return administration systems, and improves performance via return decision support by 37%. iRAES is designed to accelerate product return administration, and improve the performance of product return knowledge management. © 2013 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.",Case-based reasoning; Intelligent agent; Intelligent system design; Product return,Algorithms; Data mining; Decision support systems; Expert systems; Intelligent systems; Knowledge management; Administration system; Agent based; Data mining algorithm; Decision supports; End users; Information transparency; Product returns; Recommender agent; System architectures; Intelligent agents,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871796707

The product returns are random and price-sensitive. To maximise his profit, the manufacturer needs to optimally decide on the acquisition price for the returned product as well as the quantities of the new product to be manufactured and the returned product to be remanufactured. We investigate two cases based on the relative lengths of the manufacturing and remanufacturing lead times. (1) In the case with a shorter manufacturing lead time, the manufacturer first decides his acquisition price for the returned product before the production starts, and then decides the quantities of manufacturing/remanufacturing after the product returns are realised. (2) In the case with a shorter remanufacturing lead time, the manufacturer first decides the manufacturing quantity and the acquisition price simultaneously, and then the remanufacturing quantity based on the quantity of manufactured and returned products.

The proposed solution method evolves a set of reference solutions on the basis of a novel Adaptive Path Relinking framework. The latter encompasses an adaptive multisolution recombination procedure to generate provisional solutions based on the recurrence of particular solution attributes.

In this article, we position return management as a process that is at the interface of both inventory and revenue management by explicitly incorporating the return policy of the retailer in consumer's valuation. We consider a retailer that sells a fixed amount of inventory over a finite horizon. We assume that return policy is a decision variable that can be changed dynamically at every period. While flexible return policies generate more demand, it also induces more returns. We characterize the optimal dynamic return policies based on two costs of return scenarios. We show a conditional monotonicity result and discuss how these return policies change with respect to inventory and time. We then propose a heuristic and prove that it is asymptotically optimal. We also study the joint dynamic pricing and dynamic return management problem in the same setting and propose two more heuristics whose performance is tested numerically and found to be close to optimal for higher inventory levels. We extend our model to multiple competing retailers and characterize the resulting equilibrium return policy and prices. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",consumer returns; dynamic pricing; pricing and return management; return policy; revenue management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869012656

This study describes the specific features of green supply-chain design considering end-of-life products. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model to obtain the optimal closed-loop supply-chain (CLSC) network design, in which recovery process occurs in three different ways: material recovery, component recovery, and product recovery. An extensive analysis is supported by numerical results which inform CLSC managers about the opportunities of enhancing product returns in terms of quality and quantity. To define a better CLSC strategy to increase system profitability, the volume of product returns and corresponding quality conditions should be considered in the design of a CLSC network. The numerical study provides information for us to discuss the potential benefits of product-recovery processes and the reaction of system profitability to the changes in specific CLSC parameters. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",closed-loop supply-chain network; product recovery; product-return quantity; quality,Computer programming; Computer system recovery; Image quality; Profitability; Recovery; Supply chains; Closed-loop; Component recovery; End-of-life products; Environmental requirement; Manufacturing operations; Material recovery; Mixed integer linear programming model; Network design; Numerical results; Numerical studies; Potential benefits; Product recovery; Product returns; product-return quantity; Recovery process; Product design,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861391274

One of the crucial issues of food supply chain is to maintain the quality of the product manufactured at a constant and regular. Changes in quality or defects are a problem for many reasons.

In such cases, channel members have to decide which firm will own the units until demand uncertainty is resolved. The decision about who should retain ownership depends on the balance of benefit and risk to each member. Ownership, after all, is costly. Whichever member owns the units accepts the risk of loss if more units are produced than can be sold. But ownership also grants firms the flexibility to respond to demand once it becomes known by adjusting price. In this study, we analyze ownership decisions in distribution channels and how those decisions are affected by demand uncertainty. We model demand based on micromodeling of consumer utility functions and capture demand uncertainty related to market size and price sensitivity. This study shows that as long as the degree of uncertainty about market size is intermediate, the retailer and the manufacturer both benefit when the manufacturer maintains ownership of the units. But when there is substantial uncertainty about market size, the retailer and the channel are better off if the retailer takes ownership but the manufacturer still prefers to maintain ownership. Thus, there is potential for channel conflict regarding ownership under high levels of uncertainty. We show that, using product returns, the manufacturer can achieve the same outcome under retailer ownership as under manufacturer ownership. This provides an additional new rationale for the prevalence of product returns. The firstbest outcome (from the perspective of total channel profit), however, is under retailer ownership without product returns when uncertainty is high (i.e., product returns reduce the total channel profit). Negotiations between the manufacturer and the retailer can lead to the first-best outcome but only under quite restrictive constraints that include direct side payments by the retailer to the manufacturer and the retailerbeing pessimistic about its outside option (when an agreement cannot be reached) during the negotiation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",Channels; Demand uncertainty; Lead time; Negotiations; Pricing; Product returns,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956440018

Consequently, the importance of reverse logistics (RL) has grown drastically in recent years. To maintain effective and efficient RL operations, the enterprises adopt various approaches to improve their performance. In the literature, Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has been used where enterprises can link their performance to their RL practices. With corporate social responsibility and environmental legislation initiatives, RL enterprises need to constantly review the expectations of their stakeholders in order to ensure steady growth. The perspectives of BSC do not provide an understanding of the RL operating objectives and the developing strategies through an analysis of stakeholders. Hence, a multi-angle perspective is more helpful for RL enterprises to do their comprehensive performance measurement. In this research, for comprehensive RL performance measurement, we propose integrated framework of BSC and Performance Prism that rectify the drawbacks in previous frameworks while incorporating their strengths. The conceptual comprehensive performance framework for RL enterprise describes the link between RL drivers and measurable performance.

It concluded that with the increase in return rate, proportion of new product returns, continuous-time discount rate, price of recovery product and remanufacturing productivity, marginal time value was increased. It was needed to speed up the returns flow and increase the response of reverse supply chain.",Marginal time value; Product returns; Reverse logistics; Reverse supply chains,Logistics; Continuous time; Discount rates; High response; New product; Product returns; Reverse logistics; Reverse supply chains; Time values; Time-sensitivity; Supply chains,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81355123201

Demand of these products depends on several factors such as price, quality, service etc. Apart from these, many business practices have revealed that presence of a larger quantity of goods displayed at retail level also attract customers considerably. This paper captures the stock dependency phenomenon and investigates the role of quantity discounts and returns policies in the coordination of a supply chain. Here, the manufacturer in addition to returns policy provides quantity discounts to two competing retailers who face price-sensitive, stock dependent and uncertain demand. Using the newsvendor framework, a combined contract model is developed and sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the impact of various parameters on supply chain coordination. The result shows that proposed contract mechanism fails to coordinate when the value of price sensitivity factor approaches the value of cross price sensitivity factor. Further, price-sensitivity and cross-price sensitivity have little effect on coordination benefit at lower values of stock dependency whereas there is a significant impact at higher values of stock dependency. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Buyback contract; Newsvendor problem; Quantity discounts; Retail competition; Supply chain coordination,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052906824

This paper considers a supplier-retailer channel to design the optimal return policy for the supplier. It is assumed that the supply chain operates under uncertain demands, which is represented by fuzzy sets. We first study the return policy in a supply chain with symmetric channel information, i.e. the channel information is completely shared between the supplier and the retailer. Further we assume the retailer keeps retail price information private, i.e. the channel information is asymmetric. Thus, the supplier makes the return policy on the basis of estimated retail price which is described as a fuzzy number. We formulate an inventory model with fuzzy demand and fuzzy retail price for the supplier to make a suitable return policy so that the retailer could be motivated to make the optimal order decision to improve the overall supply chain performance. Finally, some characteristics of the return policy are discussed, and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the model applicability. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sustainability in all sphere of the design approach requires compliance with regulations and standards. The concept of the reverse logistics and take back is getting very important in the wake of product recalls for exclusive compliance of safety requirements to satisfy the regulations. That is why it is very important that the reverse logistic supply chain net work for the product return lead time and life cycle impact of product planning should begins long before disposal and at the new product design time. This is why it is now believed to be best the way to measure the impact through a Life cycle analysis and reverse logistic planning which necessarily to be decided at the conceptual stage as to how the steps and stage of reverse logistic will be followed. The EU End of life vehicle directive and its effect are very important in this direction. A conceptual model is presented in this regard which shows the role of reverse logistic and life cycle assessment of the product like packaging of plastic for which there is dearth of significant reverse logistic aspect that can influences the manufacturer's choice for the potential consumer. The dynamics in the lead time affect performance if this can be maximized stochastically in the wake of product take back and recalls for establishing global green economy. However, the model describes the function from the retailer path with which is the vital connection for other products like fridge, deep freezers, air conditions, juicers, mixers, cooking range heaters etc can be done by using the reverse logistic for re-manufacturing. Reverse Logistic and Life cycle analysis planning determines the big picture of the entire life cycle of the product in a holistic fashion for making policy decision and recommendations for all stake holders of the global market economy. Besides after the unloaded products to the specified consumer market station the return path of the same delivery service can be utilized logically for the reverse logistic and product take back.

The hypotheses were that leadership leads to infrastructure practices, which in turn support quality practices. These quality practices improve quality performance. This was tested using a structural equation model. In general, the model was supported although all of the individual practices examined here were not statistically significant. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of quality managers of firms located within Thailand was conducted and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine how leadership affected quality practices which in turn affected quality performance. The interactions of leadership with infrastructure and core variables were tested and found to be insignificant. Findings: The SEM established that leadership behaviors supported one infrastructure practice - human resource management, which in turn supported one core QM practice - statistical process control. While six dimensions of transformational and two dimensions of transactional analysis were tested, only two dimensions of transformational and one dimension of transactional leadership were retained. However, these did load onto one leadership second-order factor. The interactions of leadership with infrastructure and core practices were not significant. The core practices significantly affected three quality performance measures - product returns, product rework and scrap levels. Research limitations/implications: Further investigation is needed to understand how the Thai culture affects the use of quality practices. Since there was only one respondent per company, the study needs additional validation. Further investigation of the transformational and transactional leadership constructs is necessary. Practical implications: This suggests to international managers that many of the quality techniques are useful in both developing countries and developed countries. It also suggests that transactional leadership was more effective than prior literature expected it be. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates that leadership in Thailand is important to the implementation of quality practices. The findings indicate that leadership is an important component of QM and affects infrastructure practices which in turn affect core quality practices. Finally, these core practices affect quality performance. This confirms prior QM models. A major finding is the importance of the contingent punishment dimension of transactional leadership. The confirmatory factor analysis suggests that the individual dimensions of transformational and transactional leadership are not reliable as currently operationalized and further work is needed to develop reliable leadership scales. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Quality management; Thailand; Total quality management; Transactional leadership; Transformational leadership,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053085194

Extracting these textual segments from the item descriptions is non-trivial as they contain html markups, advertisements, templates, and navigational elements. Since sellers have considerable editorial freedom in how to describe their items, many of the descriptions lack homogeneity and compactness. Very often, the relevant information has to be extracted from incomplete, ill-formed discourse units adding to the challenge of finding coherent segments. In this paper we describe an approach that identifies item-specific text segments from eBay descriptions. This approach uses a bootstrapping technique to learn high-quality semantic lexicons for item-agnostic text segments. We first extract useful text by removing html markups using a boiler-plate removal technique that preserves markup information and captures visual segmentation. Each segment is further processed to extract discourse units that play the same role as sentences. This is followed by a clustering technique that identifies thematic breaks to extract coherent segments. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of descriptions and show that our approach outperforms a commonly-used approach that relies only on the title keywords.

The paper reports that product returns in retail SMEs can no longer be ignored in the current economic climate. Fierce competition coupled with small profit margins means that retailers find it increasingly difficult to ignore lost revenue from product returns. The paper introduces and details product return procedures normally used in retail SMEs. A focussed look at two similar retail SMEs (Alpha and Beta) in the consumer electronics market reveals very similar product return practices that under close scrutiny appear to be inefficient. Previous research reveals little or no work has been done to model and simulate product return procedures in retail SMEs. The research study uses discrete event simulation (DES) to model and simulate the effects of product returns in SMEs and explore strategies to reduce their affect on the supply chain. Witness simulation software has been used to develop a base model representing product return procedures from which inefficiencies were identified and reduced to produce an efficient simulation model.

This paper analytically studies the use of RFID in a two-echelon single-manufacturer single-retailer supply chain with the vendor managed inventory (VMI) scheme. First, the supply chain models under a retail replenishment problem with and without RFID are constructed. Second, both the levels of risk and the expected profits of the supply chains are explored. Third, measures which can coordinate the supply chains with and without RFID are proposed. Fourth, comparisons between the cases with and without RFID are made. This paper analytically illustrates several important managerial insights which include: (i) when the RFID tag cost is very small, employing the RFID technology yields an improved supply chain with both larger expected profit and smaller risk; (ii) there exist multiple return policies which can coordinate the supply chain with RFID and the respective upper and lower bounds are identified; (iii) it is beneficial for the manufacturer to take the initiative to share the retailer's cost of RFID implementation, and this action not only can help coordinate the supply chain but also lower the manufacturer's risk; and (iv) compared to the case without RFID, the return rate under the coordinating return policy for the case with RFID can be lower if the RFID tag cost is appropriately shared between the retailer and the manufacturer. These insights are important for both industrialists and academicians. © 2011 IEEE.",Inventory management; radio frequency identification (RFID); risk analysis; supply chain coordination,Cryptography; Inventory control; Manufacture; Profitability; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Radio navigation; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Sales; Expected profits; Inventory management; Multiple returns; Radio frequencies; Return policy; RF-ID tags; RFID Technology; supply chain coordination; Supply chain models; Upper and lower bounds; Vendor managed inventory; Supply chain management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051791597

Sustainability in all sphere of the design approach requires compliance with regulations and standards. The concept of the reverse logistics and take back is getting very important in the wake of product recalls for exclusive compliance of safety requirements to satisfy the regulations. That is why it is very important that the reverse logistic supply chain net work for the product return lead time and life cycle impact of product planning should begins long before disposal and at the new product design time. This is why it is now believed to be best the way to measure the impact through a Life cycle analysis and reverse logistic planning which necessarily to be decided at the conceptual stage as to how the steps and stage of reverse logistic will be followed. The EU End of life vehicle directive and its effect are very important in this direction. A conceptual model is presented in this regard which shows the role of reverse logistic and life cycle assessment of the product like packaging of plastic for which there is dearth of significant reverse logistic aspect that can influences the manufacturer's choice for the potential consumer. The dynamics in the lead time affect performance if this can be maximized stochastically in the wake of product take back and recalls for establishing global green economy. However, the model describes the function from the retailer path with which is the vital connection for other products like fridge, deep freezers, air conditions, juicers, mixers, cooking range heaters etc can be done by using the reverse logistic for re-manufacturing. Reverse Logistic and Life cycle analysis planning determines the big picture of the entire life cycle of the product in a holistic fashion for making policy decision and recommendations for all stake holders of the global market economy. Besides after the unloaded products to the specified consumer market station the return path of the same delivery service can be utilized logically for the reverse logistic and product take back. In the next generation of logistics, proactive companies must be innovative enough to integrate all strategic and operational factors in their reverse-logistics systems studies for their product take back as a part of a Comprehensive design for the new product & process system life cycle analysis.

This is largely due to the high economic benefits prevalent in some industries today and to the increasing opportunities for resale in secondary and global markets. This paper attempts to model the profitability of returns policy in presence of a secondary market, to a profit-maximizing manufacturer in a newsvendor framework. The returns policy applies both for the unsold merchandise left at the end of the selling season and the items returned by the unsatisfied customers within the specified time period. With a returns policy, the manufacturer shares the risks of demand uncertainty, in turn assuaged by the availability of secondary market. The manufacturer's decision is to arrive at an optimal wholesale price and the returns policy, based on the retailer's reaction on that offer. The retailer in turn optimizes the retail price and the order quantity to meet a price-dependent uncertain demand. This set of optimal policies has then been contrasted to that obtained from maximizing the combined profit of the manufacturer and of the retailer. The key question in the comparison has been clearly answered. The total combined profit that coordinates the policies of both channels exceeds that of the sum of the profits obtained independently. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Buyback policy; Channel coordination; Newsvendor problem; Price-dependent demand; Secondary market; Supply chain management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051945502

The electoral competitors show a changing phase of investment and return policy. Every elector has to spend and realize his costs in his tenure. In the case of defeated electors, even the cost recovery is not possible directly; there are indirect means to recover their costs. The series of case studies show the method of party funding, campaign financing, electoral expenditure, and cost recovery. Regulations could not restrict the level of spending. Several cases of disproportionate accumulation of wealth by the politicians reveal that money played a major part in electoral process.

The retailer purchases a specific component from each supplier for assembling into a fashionable product. After ordering from the long-lead-time supplier (Supplier 1) and before ordering from the short-lead-time supplier (Supplier 2), the retailer can update its demand forecast for the product. The retailer can partially cancel its order from Supplier 1 after forecast updating. By formulating the problem as a dynamic optimization problem, we explore the measures that can be deployed to coordinate the retailer's ordering decisions with forecast updating. We analytically show that the supply chain can be coordinated if both suppliers offer a returns policy and Supplier 1 charges an order-cancelation penalty to the retailer. We find that the coordination mechanism is independent of demand distribution and the forecast updating process. We further show that it is easier for the suppliers to coordinate the supply chain if market observation indicates the future market demand is sufficiently large. We also study the case where demand is price-dependent and propose a generalized revenue-sharing contract to coordinate the supply chain.

We develop a periodic-review single-product inventory system with price-dependent customer demand. The product return in each period is random but can be actively controlled by the firm's acquisition effort. The firm aims to maximize its total discounted profit over a finite planning horizon by implementing optimal production, remanufacturing, product acquisition, and pricing strategies. We first show that with an exogenous selling price, the optimal production-remanufacturing-disposal policy is simple and characterized by three state-independent parameters. The optimal acquisition effort is decreasing in the aggregate inventory level of serviceable product and cores. Nevertheless, when pricing is an endogenous decision, we find that the optimal policy becomes much more complicated, and its control parameters are state dependent. The optimal selling price is decreasing, whereas the optimal acquisition effort is increasing in the serviceable product inventory level, and both decisions decrease with the aggregate inventory level. © 2011 INFORMS.",Inventory control; Optimal policy; Pricing; Product acquisition; Remanufacturing,Costs; Inventory control; Manufacture; Optimization; Profitability; Sales; Control parameters; Customer demands; Discounted profit; Dynamic pricing; Finite planning horizon; Inventory levels; Inventory management; Inventory systems; Optimal policies; Optimal production; Optimal selling price; Pricing; Pricing strategy; Product acquisition; Product inventory; Product returns; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing program; Selling prices; State-dependent; Used product; Mergers and acquisitions,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957476590

Yet very little information is available about the types of puppies sold via the Internet. In addition these sales are not subject to United States Depart of Agriculture (USDA) regulation. The objectives of the study were to describe puppies sold via the Internet, to assess the characteristics that contribute to the cost of a puppy, and to compare puppies sold via the Internet with puppies sold by American Kennel Club (AKC) Parent Club breeders. Over 14 weeks in 2008, Yorkshire Terrier, Shih Tzu, English Bulldog, Boxer, and Labrador Retriever puppies for sale on two large-scale online puppy sales sites were categorized based on their Internet advertisements. Data were collected in three categories: puppy characteristics, health characteristics, and policies (such as spay/neuter requirement, health guarantee, and return policy). After the survey was completed, 25 AKC Parent Club breeders and 25 other breeders who advertised via one of the puppy sales websites were randomly selected and interviewed over the phone. Small breed puppies were most frequently advertised with 35.2% (1228/3485) of advertisements for Yorkshire Terriers and 23.0% (802/3485) for Shih Tzus. Almost one quarter of Internet breeders 768/3474 (22.2%) advertised four or more different dog breeds. Champion bloodlines increased the cost of a puppy of all breeds. AKC Parent Club breeders 21/25 (84%) were more likely to mention breed-specific health screening tests when compared to Internet breeders 7/25 (28%). Consumers should apply the same standards for purchasing from a breeder found through a puppy sales site as they would for purchasing from a local breeder. Breeders who advertise at one of the large-scale puppy sales websites are less knowledgeable about breed-specific health issues compared to an AKC Parent Club breeder.

It also examines the distinction, relationship, and relative effects of the two dimensions of product uncertainty on actual product returns, and how online marketplaces can use IT-enabled mechanisms to mitigate product uncertainty.

The Silver-Meal based approach revealed in a large numerical study the best performance for the separate setup cost setting, i.e. the replenishment options remanufacturing and manufacturing are charged separately for each order. This contribution generalises the Silver-Meal based heuristic by applying methods elaborated for the corresponding static problem and attaching two simple improvement steps.

Analysis shows that the majority of car recalls are initiated by a few car makers that are facing an increase in recalls and customer complaints. There exists a significant influence of customer complaints on car recalls. Furthermore, the latest car models seem to have less customer complaints compared to older models, and they also have less recalls compared to the older models. The research examines Toyota's case of recent recalls and identified some immediate impacts of recalls on sales and on market share.

But there is a lack of research that can offer guidance to practitioners in choosing the best supply contract among a group of popular contracts. This paper aims to fill this gap by developing an intelligent rule-based supply contract design system for choosing the best contract and its parameters from a supplier's point of view. Design/methodology/approach - The approach used in this paper is based on the comparison of several supply contracts that are encountered in supply chain practice. The paper aims at identifying the conditions under which one supply contract outperforms another from the supplier's perspective. To facilitate the implementation of the decision-making rules that are developed in this research, an intelligent decision support system is developed. Findings - Six popular contracts are analysed; returns policy (RP), quantity discount (QD), target rebate (TR), backup agreement (BA), quantity flexibility (QF), and quantity commitment (QC). The main findings are: QD contracts generate larger expected profits for the supplier than TR contracts do when the demand is exogenous, an RP contract is better than a QD contract when the wholesale profit margin is sufficiently large and that the optimal QC contract always provides a higher expected service level than BA and QF contracts. Originality/value - The paper presents an approach for developing an intelligent supply contract design system that can offer guidance to practitioners in choosing the best supply contract for a particular supplier. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

An efficient reverse distribution structure may lead to a significant return on investment as well as a significantly increased competitiveness in the market. Therefore, analysis of the interaction among the major barriers, which hinder or prevent the application of reverse logistics, is a crucial issue. Existing models have focused on diagnosing these barriers independently. As a result, the holistic view in understanding the barriers is not accounted for.

Because products are returned under different operational conditions, they usually require different remanufacturing effort/costs. Motivated by a project with a major energy company that manages its inventory through options of ordering and remanufacturing returned products (cores) in various condition, in this paper, we study a single-product, periodic-review inventory system with multiple types of cores. The serviceable products used to fulfill stochastic customer demand can be either manufactured from new parts or remanufactured from the cores, and the objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over a finite planning horizon. We show that the optimal manufacturing- remanufacturing-disposal policy has a simple structure and can be completely characterized by a sequence of constant control parameters when manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are the same. To demonstrate the value of the optimal policy, we conduct a numerical study that compares its performance with two simple heuristics, namely, pull policy without and with sorting. The results show that the reduction in system cost by using the optimal policy can be significant. When manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are different, we develop a heuristic method for computing the near-optimal control policy that performs quite well as demonstrated numerically. © 2011 INFORMS.",Base-stock policies; Inventory system; Optimal manufacturing and remanufacturing strategies; Product returns; Remanufacturing; Reverse logistics,Control; Heuristic methods; Inventory control; Manufacture; Base stock policy; Inventory system; Optimal manufacturing; Product returns; Remanufacturing; Reverse logistics; Optimization,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951911651

Beyond the handling of recycling and reuse, there is a tremendous scope for analysis of the returns in the RL process for identifying the causative factors. An analysis of causative factors may help in taking remedial measures for reduction in number of returns.

This has led experts to highlight the existence of a ""long tail"" of offerings on the web and assert that the future of online business is ""selling less of more."" However, it is difficult for Internet retailers of physical goods to sell a large scope of products without having to handle potentially large amounts of product returns from customers. This is due to the fact that customers can and do get overwhelmed by excessive product variety and often make erroneous purchasing decisions. We shed light on this issue through an assessment of theoretical predictions based on data from sales and returns of almost 7000 products in a particular product category. While retailers can benefit from expanding the scope of their inventories to generate Internet sales, the success of this strategy will depend on the control of unjustified product returns by consumers and the management of recurrent execution errors and product fit failures in transactions with customers. Furthermore, from our results, the gains that this strategy will bring to retailers will be bound by the amount of time products have been available on the Internet retailer's site, as well as by other attributes such as product price and size. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The online channel offers potential benefits in selling to customer segments that value the convenience of online shopping, but it also raises new challenges. These include the higher likelihood of costly product returns when customers' ability to ""touch and feel"" products is important in determining fit. We study competing retailers that can operate dual channels (""bricks and clicks"") and examine how pricing strategies and physical store assistance levels change as a result of the additional Internet outlet. A central result we obtain is that when differentiation among competing retailers is not too high, having an online channel can actually increase investment in store assistance levels (e.g., greater shelf display, more-qualified sales staff, floor samples) and decrease profits. Consequently, when the decision to open an Internet channel is endogenized, there can exist an asymmetric equilibrium where only one retailer elects to operate an online arm but earns lower profits than its bricks-only rival. We also characterize equilibria where firms open an online channel, even though consumers only use it for research and learning purposes but buy in stores. A number of extensions are discussed, including retail settings where firms carry multiple product categories, shipping and handling costs, and the role of store assistance in impacting consumer perceived benefits. © 2011 INFORMS.",Channels of distribution; Competition; Internet marketing; Product returns; Retailing; Reverse logistics,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751508491

Returns may be either remanufactured for reselling or dismantled for spare parts. Reselling a remanufactured unit typically yields higher unit margins. However, demand is uncertain. A common policy in many firms is to rank disposition alternatives by unit margins. We propose a profit-maximization approach that considers demand uncertainty. We develop single period and multiperiod stochastic optimization models for the disposition problem. Analyzing these models, we show that the optimal allocation balances expected marginal profits across the disposition alternatives. A detailed numerical study reveals that our approach to the disposition problem outperforms the current practice of focusing exclusively on high-margin options, and we identify conditions under which this improvement is the highest. In addition, we show that a simple myopic heuristic in the multiperiod problem performs well. © 2011 The Authors Decision Sciences Journal © 2011 Decision Sciences Institute.",Closed-Loop Supply Chains; Inventory Management/Coordination; Markovian Decision Processes; Yield Management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960882407

Returning such a product is generally not allowed. However, if a return policy is offered, the producer may gain significant competitive advantages. The producer can gain the advantage of the return policy if the product design is highly modular. Modularity in design implies that the product is made up of a number of modules and expresses the degree to which the product can be disassembled into components, which keep their full initial value. When a BTO product with modular design is returned, it is easily disassembled into a number of components, which are used to build new BTO products. A firm applying a return policy to BTO products refunds to the customer a value for the returned product. This amount is critically related to the level of modularity. Mukhopadhyay & Setoputro (2005, Optimal return policy and modular design for build-to-order products. J. Oper. Manage., 23, 496-506) developed a profit maximization model to jointly determine optimal return policy and modularity level for BTO products in a two parties (producer-buyer) supply chain system, using selling price as a given exogenous parameter. In this paper, the above model is extended by considering the selling price of the BTO product as an additional decision variable. From the resulting three-dimensional constrained maximization problem, closed-form optimal solutions for the decision variables are obtained under certain conditions imposed on the model's parameters. A comparative static and numerical analysis of optimal selling price, refund and modularity level is also conducted. © The authors 2009.",Build-to-order; Modularity; Return policy; Reverse logistics; Supply chain,Chains; Competition; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Inventory control; Numerical analysis; Optimization; Profitability; Sales; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Three dimensional; Build-to-order; Build-to-order products; Closed form; Comparative statics; Competitive advantage; Decision variables; Initial values; Maximization problem; Modular designs; Modularity; Number of components; Optimal selling price; Optimal solutions; Profit maximization; Return policy; Reverse logistics; Selling prices; Supply chain systems; Product design,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952841377

In common with other Mars exploration missions, human supervision of Europe's ExoMars Rover will be mostly indirect via orbital relay spacecraft and thus far from immediate. The gap between issuing commands and witnessing the results of the consequent rover actions will typically be on the order of several hours or even sols. In addition, it will not be possible to observe the external environment at the time of action execution. This lengthens the time required to carry out scientific exploration and limits the mission's ability to respond quickly to favorable science events. To increase potential science return for such missions, it will be necessary to deploy autonomous systems that include science target selection and fast planning/scheduling problem solving. The paper discusses the design of hybrid architecture agent aimed to harmonize high level decision making processes and uncertainties facing to better simulate the human reasoning. A top-down reasoning to generate a feasible activities schedule from given goals and system knowledge together with bottom-up strategy to assure robustness to unavoidable uncertainties are applied to make the agent be reactive, on the very short term, and deliberative, on the long term scenario. The proposed architecture is made of a Planner/Scheduler module (PS), for enabling dynamic actions schedule generation, exploiting a Graphplan-like algorithm to search for a feasible plan, search for the actions, pre-loaded into the: System Knowledge Base (KB), that satisfies the states required by each goal Once the plan is created the agent uses the Simple Temporal Network (STN) representation as temporal reasoning engine, to create a flexible schedule. The Executer (EXEC) module is devoted to map the PS solution space formalized in time into the system hyperspace, the basis of the behavior-based system formalism. The hybrid architecture agent, presented in this work, has been tested on an ExoMars rover-like simulated mission, with different, increasing in complexity, nominal, unpredictable and failure occurrence mission scenarios.

These factors in addition to the inherent cost and complexity of recovery processes are due to multidimensional factors and relationships associated with the quality, variety, timeliness, demand changes, and logical processing of product returns. A Reverse Enterprise System (RES) perspective will give scope to develop a flexible system that can handle products with various options and greater return volumes and variability. It explores the various recovery functions and product lifecycle stages and suggests some key business and performance measurement strategies that can be employed to be successful in returns handling. We observed that different recovery nodes act in a relatively autonomous fashion to decide what type and level of flexibility to use, what and when the information is required to be shared for improving decision performance and obtaining benefits from the recovery process.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the use to post-use stage of the product lifecycle, that may have significant potential for increasing product utilisation value and reducing product disposal to landfills. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a re-classification of the 6R (reduce, recover, redesign, reuse, recycle, remanufacturing) methodology for rectifying waste minimisation along a supply chain, to increase product utilisation at the post-use stage. Findings - Intensive study of 6R considerations to improve end-of-life planning and strategy and extend of product lifecycle management is lacking. None of the existing supply chain frameworks clearly illustrates the aspects of 6R perspectives for the use to post-use stage. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is that this study only focuses on 6R perspective for achieving waste minimisation along a supply chain. There is a need to explore various practical issues of the implementation, including the establishment of specific performance metrics for various manufacturing industries to assess organisational performance. Practical implications - This proposed sustainable supply chain for collaborative manufacturing may provide a very useful source of what needs to be implemented and achieved to meet the requirements of sustainability, which is the current and future trend of manufacturing. Originality/value - This paper provides some of the insights into holistic aspects of 6R perspective to increase product utilisation value between use and post-use stages. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

It is also important to identify the level of existing integration between parties, as this has been associated with supply chain performance. This paper seeks to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: Elements gathered from the literature reviewed are used to present a set of measures that can be applied for auditing purposes in: the forward supply chain; product returns and reverse logistics; flows of materials and information and integration between supply chain tiers. To illustrate the use of the proposed set of measures for auditing purposes a case study involving a major European mobile phone network operator was analysed using the operator's own brand of handsets characterised for having a closed-loop supply chain. Findings: The proposed set of measures for auditing purposes provide an overall picture of the performance of a closed-loop supply chain by revealing high levels of stock for the products analysed, consequence of the difficulty to generate accurate forecasts and the accumulation of high quantities of product prior to launch. Also the methodology presented in this paper identifies links between product returns (faulty and non-faulty) to operations in the forward component of the supply chain (design, sourcing, manufacturing and forecasting) and also indicates how performance is affected because of integration. Research limitations/implications: The proposed set of measures for auditing purposes is relevant to closed-loop supply chains which are related to products with short life cycles and during their lifetime can experience faulty and non-faulty returns. The scope of the study presented may look limited; however, the application of the performance measures presented in this research can become a fundamental component of larger audit exercises. Further research should be carried out with supply chains on products with lifetime cycles that span long periods of time. Practical implications: For industry sectors with closed-loop supply chains, the availability of a set of measures that address the forward and reverse components plus integration can provide a detailed picture of the performance of value streams over traditional approaches to measurement that focus on only one component of the supply chain. The set of measures has the potential to be used to achieve better customer service and reduction in costs involving shipping, warehousing, labour and call centres. Originality/value: The contribution of this research on closed-loop supply chains is a methodology that defines performance measures for auditing purposes of the forward and reverse components of supply chains and assists in assessing the importance of integration between different tiers of supply chains. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Distribution management; Performance measures; Supply chain management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751650912

Processing returns is only half the battle. The information that retailers can glean from that return transaction is of equal importance.

In the case of separated children, the difficulties seem to be even greater. In the Netherlands, many of these children disappear from the reception centres for unknown destinations, instead of returning to their home country. The new, stricter return policies adopted by the Dutch government in recent years have not (yet) changed this situation. In an explorative study of separated children aged between 15 and 18, the implementation and results of these policies were studied. The impact of the activities designed to promote voluntary return appeared to be very limited. Most separated young people did not want to consider return and did not take any action in this regard. Forced return rarely constituted a viable alternative. These findings may be explained by several factors. Among other things, considerations pertaining to personal security, family circumstances, and structural conditions in the countries of origin influence both the attitudes and behaviours of separated children, and host government policies. Moreover, many children were not willing to discuss their return with the youth care workers who were supposed to discuss and promote a voluntary return with them. The fact that most of the young people were allowed to stay in the reception centres until their eighteenth birthday enabled them to postpone making a final decision. A forced return was hindered by such obstacles as the absence of documents and the lack of appropriate care in the country of origin.

This paper presents a case study suggested by the managers of a distribution firm that seeks to balance environmental impact with cost in an industrial distribution network configuration decision incorporating product returns, which is currently taking place. While this can be modelled using mathematical programming, nonlinear terms in the objective functions as well as the likeliness that a large number of combinations of binary decision variables result suggest that this will not be able to be relied upon for a solution. For this reason, we propose a heuristic that aims at finding the Pareto-efficient frontier, which managers can use to deliberate the best solution balancing cost and environmental impact, according to the relative trade-offs of various possible configurations. We illustrate this heuristic on the Italian region of Liguria, and further explore trade-offs juxtaposing the regions of Lombardi and Sicily.

By assuming that two chains face two forms of customer returns that are proportional to sales and that increase with the retail price, we compare the distinct impacts of the two forms of customer returns on pricing and production quantity decisions under two competition games. We show that customer returns in one chain affect the decisions of not only this chain but also its competitor’s chain, and that two chains have different responses to different forms of customer returns. We also find that under some circumstances, offering a full refund customer returns policy is a better choice as compared to not allowing customer returns.

Frequently they are part of maritime interstitial spaces between states, and their location, combined with institutional membership, makes them part of international migration routes and subject to border management strategies. In this paper borders are analysed as social institutions used for regulating relative permeability through rules of entry and exit for persons, goods and capital. Borders institutionalize territoriality and are politically implemented by states. They are selective, also in migration, and irregular border transit is not always indicative of an inability to control. The Canary Islands are used as an illustrative example of how border management at the southern edge of the European Union has evolved towards more coercive deterrence and tighter surveillance. The Canary Islands experienced irregular maritime immigration from the west African coasts during the first decade of the 21st century and most of these migrants intended to use the islands as transit space towards the European continent. Increasing surveillance in countries of origin, enforcement of border controls and stricter return policies were used to stop flows.

Improved forecast accuracy can lead to a better decision making in strategic, tactical and operational areas of the organization. Very little research has been done about the forecasting aspect of reverse logistics. For higher forecast accuracy, more robust method is required. The methodology presented here is based on the return reason codes (RC). The incoming returns are split into different categories using return reason codes. These reason codes are further analyzed to forecast returns. The computation part of this model uses a combination of two approaches namely extreme point approach and central tendency approach. Both the approaches are used separately for separate types of reason codes and then results are added together. The extreme point approach is based upon data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a first step combined with a linear regression while central tendency approach uses a moving average. For certain type of returns, DEA evaluates relative ranks of the products using single input and multiple outputs. Once this is completed, linear regression defines a correlation between relative rank (predictor variable) and return quantity (response variable). For the remaining type of returns we use a moving average of percent returns to estimate the central tendency. Thus, by combining two approaches for different types of return reason codes, we have developed a model that can be used to forecast product returns for the consumer electronics industry. © 2010 IEEE.",,Consumer electronics; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Economics; Industrial management; Technology; Extreme points; Forecast accuracy; Forecast products; Improved forecast; Little research; Moving averages; Multiple outputs; Operational area; Predictor variables; Return flow; Reverse logistics; Robust methods; Single input; Forecasting,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78549256416

In addition to stochastic demand for finished products, the system experiences stochastic returns of subsets of components, which can then be used to satisfy subsequent demands. The system is managed over an infinite horizon using a component-level base-stock policy. We identify several ways in which returns complicate the behavior of the system, and we demonstrate how to handle these additional complexities when calculating or approximating key order-based performance metrics, including the immediate fill rate, the fill rate within a time window, and average backorders. We also present a method for computing a near-optimal base-stock policy. We use these results to address managerial questions on both operational and product-design levels. For example, we find that tracking product-based (as opposed to component-based) return information appears to provide much less value than tracking product-based demand information, and we explore the impact of the number of products, component lead times, and different patterns of component returns (joint versus independent returns, returns of common versus dedicated components) on the value of component commonality. © 2009 INFORMS.",Assemble to order; Environment; Product returns; Reverse logistics; Supply chain management,Logistics; Random processes; Supply chains; Assemble to order; Backorders; Base stock policy; Component based; Component commonality; Component levels; Customer demands; Demand information; Design levels; Environment; Fill rate; Finished products; Infinite horizons; Lead time; Multi-product; Performance metrics; Product returns; Reverse logistics; Stochastic demand; Stochastic return; Time windows; Supply chain management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649989035

To date, the literature in marketing has largely focused on how marketing communications affect customer buying behavior and, to some extent, how past buying behavior affects a firm's decisions to initiate future marketing communications. However, the literature on product returns is sparse, especially in relation to analyzing individual customer product return behavior. Although the magnitude of the value of product returns is known to be high ($100 billion per year), how it affects customer buying behavior is not known because of a lack of data availability and understanding of the role of product returns in the firm-customer exchange process. Given that product returns are considered a hassle for a firm's supply chain management and a drain on overall profitability, it is important to study product return behavior. Thus, the authors empirically demonstrate the role of product returns in the exchange process by determining the exchange process factors that help explain product return behavior and the consequences of product returns on future customer and firm behavior.

Given the assumption that there are two broad categories of risks restricting foreign companies' market participation-PPP project risks and legal and regulatory barriers-it was found that the revocation of fixed return policy, current low level of water prices and its difficulty of adjustment are the most significant risks.

Typically, existing techniques assume that the product ages at the times of failure are known or can be derived based on product manufacturing data for each month of production and the corresponding monthly failure counts derived from the warranty claims. However, our experience shows that, in many cases, it may not be possible to know the failure ages of components. The information available from each month might be limited to the volume of shipments and total claims or product returns. In these cases, the data hides the component age at the time of failure. In this paper, we show that when the failure history information is incomplete, the failure distribution of the product can be determined using Bayesian analysis techniques applicable for handling incomplete data. The popular Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied to find the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) of the failure distribution parameters using incomplete data. The effectiveness of the EM algorithm is compared using several sets of incomplete warranty data generated using simulation.

A consumer's return model is proposed, and optimal pricing, quantity, as well as refund are obtained in the standard newsvendor setting. Subsequently, our researches are extended to supply chain setting, and two contracts are designed to coordinate the supply chain. Results show that the buy-back contract cannot realize supply chain coordination whereas the sales rebate contract can. Further profit allocation mechanisms under the sales rebate contract are discussed. Results indicate that the wholesale price is an important parameter influencing the profit allocation between the manufacturer and the retailer. © 2009 IEEE.",Consumer returns policy; Coordination; Perishable product; Supply chain contracts,Chains; Costs; Profitability; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Newsvendors; Perishable product; Profit allocation; Retail price; Returns policies; Supply chain coordination; Supply chain systems; Whole sale prices; Sales,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450158895

This situation is typical of most remanufacturing environments, where inputs are product returns (also called cores). Production (remanufacturing) cost increases as the quality level decreases, and any unused cores may be salvaged at a value that increases with their quality level. Decision variables include, for each period and under a certain probabilistic scenario, the amount of cores to grade, the amount to remanufacture for each quality level, and the amount of inventory to carry over for future periods for ungraded cores, graded cores, and finished remanufactured products. Our model is grounded with data collected at a major original equipment manufacturer that also remanufactures.

The aim of this study is to address this gap in extant knowledge through explicitly focusing on uncovering factors which permit consumers to exploit retailers' liberal return policies when fraudulently returning products that they know they have used or damaged. Design/methodology/approach: In-depth interviews were utilized as the main data collection method. Interviews were conducted amongst service employees and customers. A total of 87 interviews were conducted with front-line employees and managers of 12 general retail outlets. Customer interviewing involved 96 interviews. Potential customer informants were randomly contacted with a request to participate in a study of customer service and returning goods. Findings: Data analysis revealed ten main factors that appear to be related to customers' likelihood of successfully, fraudulently returning products. Research limitations/implications: As with other similar studies of this nature, the findings and implications are limited by the research design and methods employed. However, these limitations also indicate potentially fruitful avenues of future research. Future studies could employ different methods and explore differing contexts to gauge the generalizability of findings. Practical implications: The findings of the study have a range of implications for practitioners and policy makers. Insights are generated into the extent of fraudulent returning and the factors which facilitate successful fraudulent returns. As such, practitioners could use such insights to reduce the frequency of such episodes. Public policy implications centre on highlighting the issues which policy makers may wish to consider. Originality/value: The current study is the first to explore how (rather than, why) consumers exploit firms' return policies and fraudulently defraud retailers. As such, a fundamental and stark contribution centres on the finding of widespread, recidivist fraudulent returning among those interviewed. Ten facilitators of fraudulent returning were identified, providing rich insights into how customers are able, successfully, to return used and damaged products. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Consumer behaviour; Customers; Ethics; Fraud,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952716864

In the standard newsvendor setting, the returns policy and the revenue sharing contract have been shown to be able to align incentives of the supply chain's members so that the decentralized supply chain behaves as well as the integrated one. When the demand is influenced by both retail price and retailer sales effort, none of the above traditional contracts can coordinate the supply chain. To resolve this issue, we explore a variety of other contract types including joint return policy with revenue sharing contract, return policy with sales rebate and penalty (SRP) contract, and revenue sharing contract with SRP. We find that only the properly designed returns policy with SRP contract is able to achieve channel coordination and lead to a Pareto improving win-win situation for supply chain members. We then provide analytical method to determine the contract parameters and finally we use a numerical example to illustrate the findings and gain more insights. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

One of the major issues impacting remanufacturing is in the difficulty of obtaining used products (cores) that are suitable for remanufacturing. The timing and quantity of product returns is dependent on the type of product. Factors such as the mean product lifetime, rate of technical innovation, and failure rate of components all influence the return rate of products from end-of-use and end-of-life. The balance between product returns and demand for remanufactured products is a function of many variables, where the rate of technological innovation and the expected life of a product are the major influencing characteristics.

The operational decisions of interest are the selling price, return policy, and quantity of new product to purchase. We model a single selling season that is split into two periods where the boundary between periods is delineated by the opportunity to recover product returns and resell them. That is, returns in the first period can be recovered and sold in the second period. Returns also arise in the second period, but these may only be salvaged. We first analyze both deterministic and stochastic models, finding that the deterministic results largely carry over to the stochastic case. In addition, our results indicate that the model is quite insensitive to errors in the estimates of the parameter values, except for purchase cost and parameters related to demand. Finally, we perform an analysis on the value of various investments to improve financial performance. Results indicate that investments to reduce the recovery cost of returns or reduce returns uncertainty are minimal, while investments to increase recovery speed, reduce market uncertainty, and reduce the return rate can be quite valuable. © 2009 Production and Operations Management Societ.",Inventory management; Pricing; Product returns,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67649997608

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a survey of 295 retailers, this paper evaluates the influence of customer and retailer related antecedents of reverse logistics capabilities and their subsequent impact on cost savings. Findings: The results indicate that resource commitments and contractual obligations positively influence reverse logistics capabilities and that these capabilities result in cost savings. Customer opportunism is found to be negatively related to reverse logistics capabilities. It is also reported that reverse logistics capabilities partially mediates the relationship between resource commitments, contractual arrangements, and reverse logistics cost savings.

The cost and scale of returns management issues necessitate a deeper understanding of how to deal with product returns. We develop an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a seller's pricing and restocking fee policy. Taking into account the consumers' strategic behavior, we derive the seller's optimal policy as a function of consumer preferences, consumer uncertainty about product attributes, consumer hassle cost for returns, and the effectiveness of the seller's forward and reverse channel capability. We allow for two sources of consumer uncertainty and show how the seller may use its price and restocking fee as a means of targeting a segment of consumers who know their product consumption utilities. We find that even if it is possible to eliminate returns costlessly through the provision of information about the fit between consumer preferences and product characteristics, returns can nevertheless be part of an optimal product sales process. That is, we identify conditions under which it is (or is not) optimal to provide product fit information to consumers. We show that the marginal value of information to the seller is decreasing in the operational efficiency of the seller's forward and reverse logistics process as well as the level of product uncertainty. We identify the impact of multiple product options and sources of consumer uncertainty on the model's results. The analysis generates testable hypotheses about how consumer-level and seller-level parameters affect the return policies observed in the marketplace. © 2009 INFORMS.",Demand management; OM-marketing interface; Product returns; Restocking fees; Reverse logistics,Competition; Logistics; Marketing; Optimization; Purchasing; Demand management; OM-marketing interface; Product returns; Restocking fees; Reverse logistics; Costs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67449144979

First, partial returns are optimal for the manufacturer but do not induce higher stocking quantities compared with when the manufacturer offers no returns. Second, in terms of the effect of investment in demand-enhancing activities, when retailers invest, they set higher resale prices, but an optimal partial returns policy still does not induce higher stocking quantity, whereas when manufacturers invest, the optimal returns policy induces higher stocking quantity.

In the two-echelon system, the manufacturer sells a newsvendor-type product through the buyer who faces a random demand depending on advertising expenditure and selling price. Before the start of the selling period, the buyer needs to determine how much she should invest in advertising, how many units of products she should order from the manufacturer and at what price she should sell the ordered products. At the end of the selling period, when the revealed demand exceeds stock on hand, all the superfluous demand is met by a second order from the manufacturer, if unfilled customers are offered a discount in selling price. Based on the buyer's first order, the manufacturer needs to select his initial production quantity under a relatively cheap but long lead-time production mode, and responds to the buyer's second order with an expensive but quick-response production mode (if necessary). Under both the centralized and decentralized setting, we formulate mathematical models of how two members make their decisions, respectively, and provide the closed-form solution to each model. In order to achieve perfect coordination of the supply chain, we propose an improved sales rebate contract, which can arbitrarily allocate the profit between two parties.

The issue in reverse logistics is to take back the used products, either under warranty or at the end of use or at the end of lease, so that the products or its parts are appropriately disposed, recycled, reused or remanufactured. In order to overcome this issue, it is necessary to setup a logistics network for arising goods flow from end users to manufacturers.

The disposal in surface or sewage water or land of liquid content of the lead-acid batteries is strictly restricted.

The objective of this paper is to develop a multi echelon, multi period, multi product closed loop supply chain network model for product returns and the decisions are made regarding material procurement, production, distribution, recycling and disposal. The proposed heuristics based genetic algorithm (GA) is applied as a solution methodology to solve mixed integer linear programming model (MILP). Finally the computational results obtained through GA are compared with the solutions obtained by GAMS optimization software. The solution reveals that the proposed methodology performs very well in terms of both quality of solutions obtained and computational time. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, a single-product remanufacturing system is analyzed and the research of effect caused by stochastic product returns is especially focused on. A kind of pull policy considering the unserviceable inventory and serviceable inventory together is employed. A cost model, the expected value of average single-cycle cost (EASC), is constructed under certain environmental assumptions. The objection is to minimize the EASC by controlling two variables, the serviceable inventory's supplement batch and the remanufacturing product batch.

The nature of these decisions usually is considered to be multidimensional, interdisciplinary, complex, and unstructured due to lack of certainty in environment and information regarding time, quantity and quality of returns, etc. Fuzzy decision methodology provides an alternative framework to handle these reverse logistics system (RLS) complexities and to determine the decision strategies for best alternative selection for reprocessing. Designing a decision-making model for the same requires quantitative and qualitative evaluation based on criteria such as cost/time, legislative factors, environmental impact, quality, market, etc. Performance must be considered on the basis of these criteria to determine a suitable reverse manufacturing option depending on the expert opinion in this domain. In this paper, we propose a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on fuzzy-set theory. The proposed model can help in designing effective and efficient flexible return policy depending on the various criteria. Further, companies can use this analysis as a strategic decision-making tool to develop fresh reprocessing facilities or efficiently use the already exiting facility. Finally, an example has been illustrated to highlight the procedural implementation of the proposed model.

Linear regressions were undertaken to test the hypotheses. Further to the empirical research, a new model is proposed. Findings: Regression analysis using Ha's six scales of security, privacy, brand name, word of mouth, information, and (past) experience yielded an R2 of only 0.105 for the dependent variable of web brand trust.

Design/methodology/approach - A profit-maximization model is developed to determine the optimal returns policy and pricing strategy for e-marketers. Findings - The author demonstrates that an optimal returns policy and pricing strategy exists when firms sell products through an e-market. When a firm uses an e-market to sell its product, its optimal returns policy and pricing strategy is to offer a more generous returns policy and to charge a higher price when the product web-fit is strong. Furthermore, the results also show that while the returns policy always is valuable for the e-marketer, the value of returns policy increases with the product web-fit. Research limitations/implications - The present study assumed that all consumers have perfect information. However, information to the consumers could be incomplete. It is recommended that future research explores returns policy and pricing strategy under an incomplete information setting. Practical implications - This paper provides a very useful model framework, returns policy and pricing strategy for business managers who are using or planning to use the e-market to sell their products.

Watson examines how refugees and asylum seekers have come to be treated so poorly by these states through the use of policies such as visa requirements, mandatory detention and prevention/return policies. Providing extensive documentary analysis of debates on 'restrictive' refugee policies in Canada and Australia, the author addresses the relationship between security and migration, an issue of increased importance in the aftermath of 9/11 and the war on terror. He then examines hotly-contested policies such as detention and the forceful return of asylum seekers to demonstrate how attempts to securitise these issues have been resisted in the media and by political opposition. Given the importance of providing refuge for persecuted populations, not only to ensure the survival of targeted individuals, but also to maintain international peace and security, the erosion of protective measures is of great importance today.

In this paper, we mainly consider three uncertainties: (1) uncertainty of time-delay in re-manufacturing and returns, (2) uncertainty of system cost parameters, (3) uncertainty of customers' demand disturbances. Using control theories we dynamically analyse and establish a class of dynamic closed-loop supply chain models of linear discrete time system, including the product return model, the re-manufacturing model and the third party reverse logistic providers (3PRLP) collecting model. Furthermore, we analyse the robust operations in the closed-loop supply chains and bring forward relative strategies with robust H∞ control methods. Finally, according to the practical operations of scrap supply chain in the Chinese steel industry, we carry out some simulation calculations to prove how our proposed robust H control strategies can restrain all uncertainties of our closed-loop supply chain system. Our analyses and results may be helpful for further insight into closed-loop supply chain uncertain operations and production control, for both theoretical researchers and practitioners, especially for those in the Chinese steel manufacturing industry.",Closed-loop supply chain; Dynamic model; Reverse logistics; Robust H <sub>∞</sub> control; Simulation calculation,Chains; Closed loop control systems; Control theory; Delay control systems; Discrete time control systems; Dynamic models; Iron and steel industry; Iron and steel plants; Production control; Simulators; Steel scrap; Strategic planning; Supply chain management; Chinese steel industry; Closed-loop supply chain; Control methods; Control strategies; Environmental challenges; Linear discrete-time systems; Manufacturing models; Product returns; Reverse logistics; Robust H; Robust operation; Scrap supply; Simulation calculation; Steel manufacturing; System costs; Third parties; Supply chains,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449581097

Whereas the option to return merchandise leads to an increase in gross revenue, it also creates additional costs. Selecting an optimal return policy requires balancing both demand and cost implications. In this paper, we develop a structural model of a consumer's decision to purchase and return an item that nests extant choice models as a special case. The model enables a firm to both measure the value to consumers of the return option and balance the costs and benefits of different return policies. We apply the model to a sample of data provided by a mail-order catalog company. We find considerable variation in the value of returns across customers and categories. When the option value is large, there are large increases in demand. For example, the option to return women's footwear is worth an average of more than $15 per purchase to customers and increases average purchase rates by more than 50%. We illustrate how the model can be used by a retailer to optimize his return policies across categories and customers. © 2009 INFORMS.",Choice models; Consumer behavior; Decisions under uncertainty; Direct marketing; E-commerce; Econometric models; Hierarchical Bayes analysis; Latent variable models; Marketing operations interface; Returns; Service quality; Targeting,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66249102706

We integrate consumer returns policy and manufacturer buyback policy within a modeling framework and explicitly model the positive effect of refund amount on demand and its negative effect on the probability that consumers keep the products. We design a buyback/markdown money contract to coordinate the supply chain under partial refund policy and find that the refund amount plays an important role in the decisions and profitability of the players. In the coordinated setting with given buyback price, the refund amount first increases the players' expected profits/quantity, and then decreases them. When the risk (variance) of the consumer's valuation increases, the manufacturer may raise the unit wholesale price to achieve a higher unit profit. The supply chain is better off using full refund policy if the risk is very small; otherwise, the supply chain prefers no returns policy.

We find that while the higherquality firm should always provide information resolving consumer uncertainty on product quality, the lowerquality firm under certain conditions will have the higher incentive to and will be the one to provide information resolving consumer uncertainty about their quality preferences. In the analysis, we trace the latter result to competition and to free-riding on the information provision. Specifically, in a monopoly market or when consumer free-riding is restricted by the costliness of store visits, the lower-quality firm would have a lower incentive to provide information resolving consumer preference uncertainty than otherwise.

Lenient return policies insure consumers against having regret after purchasing, so they may increase consumers' likelihood of purchasing. The behavioral theory of endowment effect suggests that consumers may then have a harder time returning purchased goods because people value objects more highly once they own them. We conducted a test of our hypotheses on how return policy and endowment effect influence purchasing tendency and return rate. This experiment proved that endowment effect did affect the returning behavior of consumers. It showed that lenient return policies significantly increased initial purchasing tendency but did not increase return rate. This suggests a potential to increase consumption by adopting lenient return policies. Copyright © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

And, when doing so, should they consider assortment selection as a popularity contest - by carrying products that they think will be popular among consumers? Or, is there ever a case for carrying eccentric products - those that are least likely to be purchased by a typical consumer? In search of answers to these questions, we explore in this chapter the interactions between product assortment, return policy, and pricing decisions of a retailer. We consider a category of horizontally differentiated products delivered in two alternative supply modes: make-to-order (MTO) and make-to-stock (MTS). In the MTO mode, products are supplied after demand materializes, whereas in the MTS mode, the retailer stocks products prior to the selling season. Underlying our demand model, consumer choice behavior follows a nested multinomial logit model, with the first stage involving a product choice, and the second stage involving a keep-or-return decision. We show that the structure of the optimal assortment strongly depends on both the return policy, which we parameterize by refund fraction (percentage of price refunded upon return) and the supply mode (MTO vs. MTS). For relatively strict return policies with a sufficiently low refund fraction, it is optimal for the retailer to offer most eccentric products in the MTO mode, and a mix of most popular and most eccentric products in the MTS mode. For relatively lenient return policies, on the other hand, conventional thinking applies: the retailer selects most popular products. We also numerically study three extensions of our base model to incorporate: (1) endogenous price, (2) endogenous refund fraction, and (3) multiple periods.We demonstrate that interesting aspects of our results regarding strict return policies prevail under all of these extensions. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.",,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954491422

Some tourism networks, such as tourism distribution channels and tourism supply chain (TSC), have been explored by some researchers in recent years. The inter-organizational relationships have also received a lot of attention from researchers in tourism area. However, most studies focus on adversarial relationships due to the intensive competitions among the service providers. Many studies on coordination strategies in the manufacturing supply chains have shown that it can result in improved performance and greater profitability for the entire supply chain and participants. It is believed that applying supply chain coordination strategy to the tourism industry provides a new research opportunity to generate insights into how a TSC develops a sustainable competitive advantage, especially when the demand uncertainty is high. Along this line, this paper studies a vertical coordination relationship in a tourism supply chain consisting of tour operators and their accommodation supplier. In regular intervals, tour operators and their supplier sign contracts on the volume that the supplier will allocate to them for the coming season. In the vertical coordination scheme based on return policies, the supplier buys back the unused reservations from tour operators at the end of the season. Game models are used to analyze and establish the coordination relationship.

The target rebate mechanism is mainly to improve retailers' sales enthusiasm, increasing sales volume; while return policy can improve order quantity of the retailer effectively. In this dissertation, a two-echelon model for perishable products' supply chain is established, which is composed by one manufacturer and one retailer. At the base of analyzing the coordinating effect of the target rebate mechanism in the supply chain, we combine the return policy with the target rebate and apply them into the supply chain coordination. One combined contract model is built and studied on the implementation conditions of the supply chain coordination and win-win.

Inventory management in the context of product returns has drawn the attention of many researchers. However, the inherent complexity of the system with uncertain returns makes the analysis of the system extremely difficult. So far, the literature on this type of system is mostly limited to single echelons. The few papers available in literature on multi-echelon systems with returns base their analyses on simplified assumptions such as non-existence or non-relevance of set-up and holding costs at different levels. In this paper, we relax these assumptions and consider a two-echelon system with returns under more generalized conditions.

Using our model, we study the impact of full returns policies (e.g., using 100% money-back guarantees) and partial returns policies (e.g., when restocking fees are charged) on supply chain performance. Next, we demonstrate that consumer returns policies may distort incentives under common supply contracts (such as manufacturer buy-backs), and we propose strategies to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of consumer returns.

Most firms handle the product returns process themselves and typically within the same facilities that handle forward logistics. Returning items directly to stock, repackaging and returning to stock, and selling as scrap, were the three top disposition options employed by firms. Results indicate that, contrary to general understanding, the majority of retailers and wholesalers reported a recovery rate of over 75% of product cost.

This is a costly issue for retailers and manufacturers- in fact, it is estimated that the U.S. electronics industry alone spent $13.8 billion dollars in 2007 to restock returned products [Lawton, C. 2008. The war on returns. Wall Street Journal (May 8) D1]. The bulk of these returns were nondefective items that simply were not what the consumer wanted. To eliminate returns and to recoup the cost of handling returns, many retailers are adopting the practice of charging restocking fees to consumers as a penalty for making returns. This paper employs an analytical model of a bilateral monopoly to examine the impact of reverse channel structure on the equilibrium return policy and profit. More specifically, we examine how the return penalty is affected by whether returns are salvaged by the manufacturer or by the retailer. Interestingly, we find that the return penalty may be more severe when returns are salvaged by a channel member who derives greater value from a returned unit. Also, the manufacturer may earn greater profit by accepting returns even if the retailer has a more efficient outlet for salvaging units. © 2010 INFORMS.",Channels of distribution; Pricing; Reverse logistics,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650745359

Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on an exploratory research regarding RSCM activities of Turkish automotive, white goods, electric/electronics, and furniture industries. The sample consists of all the companies included in the Top-500 Industrial Enterprises List of The Assembly of the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO). Findings: The research findings show that the RSCM initiatives in the considered industries are still in a very early stage. Companies' involvement in product returns is mostly due to the legislative liabilities, and system inadequacies are emphasized as the most important reason for not being able to implement an efficient RSCM. Research implications/limitations: This paper investigates the reverse supply chain practices of selected industries in Turkey and aims to enable researchers to use this study as a building block in understanding these practices and related problems. The limitation of this study is to solely include the medium and large-sized companies in the industries. Practical implications: Reverse supply chain operations contribute to the economic sustainability by reducing waste and saving energy and material. In this research, an empirical study in the electronics, white goods, automotive and furniture industries is conducted, and potential research opportunities are discussed to streamline reverse supply chain activities in the industries. Hence, this study can be viewed as an attempt to increase the level of awareness on reverse supply chain issues. Originality/value: No field study has been conducted to analyze reverse supply chain activities of the industries in Turkey.

Consumers exhibit inertia when they have an inherent bias to delay purchases. Inertia may induce consumers to wait even when it is optimal to buy immediately. We embed our decision model within a dynamic pricing context. There is a firm that sells a fixed capacity over two time periods to an uncertain number of both rational and inertial consumers. We find that consumer inertia has both positive and negative effects on profits: it decreases demand (in period one) but intensifies competition among consumers for the product (in period two). We show that our model of inertia is consistent with well-established behavioral regularities, such as loss aversion and probability weighting in the sense of prospect theory, and hyperbolic time preferences. We offer practical recommendations for firms to influence the level of consumer inertia.

We develop in a noncompetitive setting three coordination models - revenue sharing, return policy, and combination of revenue sharing and return policy - and contrast them with a basic and uncoordinated model. We are able to establish the ordinal relationship among the retailer's ordering and pricing decisions and analytically compare the performances between certain models when two suppliers are identical. We find that the retailer's ordering and pricing decisions in the model with return policy in the case of identical suppliers are independent of demand or supply uncertainty. Our numerical results reveal that the performances of coordination models in the case of nonidentical suppliers resemble those in the case of identical suppliers. We find that the retailer will place a larger order quantity in models where her average cost per unit sold is smaller. We also find that product substitutability and uncertainties have different effects on chain performances. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Capacity is finite and shared between new production and recovery operations. The operational decisions of interest are the quantity of new product to produce, the quantity of returns to recover, and the quantity of returns to dispose. Product recovery is uncertain in that each returned unit can be successfully recovered with a known probability, and otherwise it is discarded at a cost. Demand in a period is satisfied with new production, recovered returns, or a mix of both types. We measure and evaluate the value of information through three information cases that separately address different types of information: demand, recovery yield, and capacity utilization. We find that there is no dominance in value amongst the different types of information, although information on capacity utilization provides the highest average value and exceeds the value of the other two types of information in 55% of the cases studied.

Some general practices and barriers were identified in the data that led to important findings relating to reverse logistics planning and operations in Asia, including attempts to recapture the value of returned products. Most product returns are deemed obsolete by virtue of being at the end of their product lifecycle with no possibility of being recycled, reused or resold. Channel partners (i.e., distributors and retailers) made most disposal decisions, as most of the respondents do not deal directly with end consumers.

The available studies in the literature consider a production environment that consists of two shops. The first shop is for production and remanufacturing/repair, while the second shop is for collecting used (returned) items to be remanufactured in the first shop, where demand is satisfied from producing new and from remanufacturing/repairing returned items. Numerical and analytical results from these developed models suggested that a pure (bang-bang) policy of either no waste disposal (total remanufacturing) or no remanufacturing (pure production and total disposal) is the best strategy, while the mixed strategy (a mixture of production and remanufacturing) is the optimum case under certain limited assumptions. In practice, the quality of the returned items and the purchasing price that reflects this quality is what usually governs a collection (or return) policy of used items. Unlike those available models in the literature, this paper suggests that the flow of returned items is variable, and is controlled by two decision variables, which are the purchasing price for returned items corresponding to an acceptance quality level. Deterministic mathematical models are presented for multiple remanufacturing and production cycles. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The success of such a transition depends on whether one is capable of escaping the lock-in of the dominant, unsustainable technology, which is usually due to multiple lock-in factors. Here, we present a formal model to study the likelihood of market lock-in in the presence of multiple increasing returns. The proposed framework describes coevolving populations of boundedly rational consumers and innovating firms. On the demand side, we focus attention on the interdependence of consumer preferences. We examine the impact of alternative demand side specifications on the direction of innovative activities of firms. On the supply side, a technological trajectory arises from the interplay of incremental innovation, search for a new product design and marketing activities. Our framework provides a general and complete account of increasing returns on supply and demand sides, as well as their synergetic interactions.

However, optimizing the expected performance alone cannot guarantee that the realized performance measure will fall within a small neighborhood of its expected value when the corresponding variance is high. Moreover, it ignores the risk aversion of supply chain members which may affect the achievability of channel coordination. As a result, we carry out in this paper a mean-variance (MV) analysis of supply chains under a returns policy. We first propose an MV formulation for a single supplier single retailer supply chain with a newsvendor type of product. The objective of each supply chain decision maker is to maximize the expected profit such that the standard deviation of profit is under the decision maker's control. We study both the cases with centralized and decentralized supply chains. We illustrate how a returns policy can be applied for managing the supply chains to address the issues such as channel coordination and risk control.

In the standard newsvendor setting, both the returns policy and the sales rebate and penalty (SRP) are coordination contracts that provide incentives to all of the supply chain's members so that the decentralized supply chain behaves nearly or exactly the same as the integrated one. When demand is influenced by the retail price and retailer sales effort, each of the returns policy and the SRP contract no longer coordinates on its own. To solve this problem, we employ a new model combined the returns policy with the SRP contract.

The extent to which this is possible depends on how well local markets are developed.

This research also includes the role of the returns policy in the customer decision-making process as a foundation for determining the appropriate disposition strategy. Design/methodology/approach – A general review of the literature and depth interviews with logistics professionals following commonly employed investigative techniques provided the foundation for the study. A survey was developed and mailed to the senior supply chain operations professional at 400 companies in the auto parts industry resulting in 118 usable responses. Findings – The current research shows that under instances of active resource commitment to reverse logistics programs, operations and supply chain managers may expect superior performance by choosing destroying, recycling, refurbishing, and/or remanufacturing of product. Practical implications – If firms focus on reverse logistics activities as a must do, a strategic approach that examines outcomes rather than day-to-day operations is suggested. If managers do not have adequate resource support for reverse logistics, they should destroy the product. The other disposition options all require significant resources in order to reclaim value from returns. Originality/value – Traditional strategy research has focused on the importance of a strategic fit between a firm's internal strengths and weaknesses and the external environment. In contrast, a resource approach stresses internal aspects of the firm.

Reverse logistics (RL), which refers to the distribution activities involved in product returns, has recently received much attention because many companies are using it as a strategic tool to serve their customers; and can generate good revenue. The management of return flow usually requires a specialised infrastructure with special information systems for tracking and dedicated equipment for the processing of returns. An efficient reverse distribution structure may lead to a significant return on investment as well as a significantly increased competitiveness in the market. Therefore, the time seems to be right for a systematic overview of various issues that are arising in the context of reverse distribution. The main purpose of this paper is to review the literature on RL and suggest a classification based on reverse distribution issues. The result of this research provides a better understanding of the RL concept and outlines some future directions of research on modelling and analysis. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",Closed loop supply chain; Decision-making; Reverse logistics; Third-party reverse logistics; Vehicle routing problem,Competition; Decision making; Economics; Investments; Profitability; Routing algorithms; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; End-of-life products; Environmental concerns; Future directions; Product recovery; Product returns; Product take-back; Re-distribution; Return flow; Return on investments; Reverse logistics; Reverse supply chains; Strategic tool; Third-party reverse logistics; Vehicle routing problem; Information management,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-72149096540

Each LCP receives a stream of returned products from consumers and once its inventory reaches its economic inventory level, these products are immediately delivered to the CRC. The CRC begins to handle those returned products when its inventory reaches its economic batch size. Special attention is placed on the joint inventory control and product return handling policies. The purpose of this study is to find the optimal economic delivery batch size for the LCPs as well as the optimal handling batch size for the CRC in order to minimize the long-run average cost for the open-loop reverse supply chain. An algorithm to find an optimal policy of delivery batch size for LCPs and handling batch size for CRC is developed. We present detailed discussions on how the optimal policy of delivery as well as the handling batch sizes changes with respect to changes in system parameters. We show that the formulas for optimal policies of delivery and handling batch sizes are modifications of the EOQ model.

Therefore, electroreduction has also been put forward as a means of inhibiting and/or reducing oxidation phenomena in milk by modifying its redox potential. However, these investigations failed to isolate the components contributing to the value of redox potential of milk. In this study, a series of electrolysis treatments were carried out to determine how the different major components of milk as well as thermal treatment influence the redox potential during and after electroreduction. It was found that the fat and protein content of the milk products, together with the heat treatments applied, have a considerable effect on the redox potential of these milk products after electroreduction. Furthermore, this change in redox potential is only temporary, since the redox potential levels of electroreduced milk products return to positive values after only 4 days of storage. Industrial relevance: The redox potential of milk, widely studied in the past, gives some indications of the oxidative quality and stability of milk. This paper presents an innovative and clean method to control the redox potential of milk products with the use of electrochemistry.

Because of the differences in and interaction between forward and reverse distribution, figuring out how to integrate the two channels has become an urgent issue. Many companies use inefficient, slow, and expensive processes for handling returned products, and many are either incapable of or unwilling to enter the reverse logistics market. Thus, more and more companies are outsourcing their distribution operations to third-party logistics providers (3PLs). In practice, 3PLs usually serve a number of clients that handle multiple products. Thus, the multiproduct aspect must be considered in any distribution network design for 3PLs. Nonetheless, almost all existing research in this field focuses only on the separate reverse distribution and homogeneous product. This paper addresses an integrated forward and reverse distribution network design problem for 3PLs that involves locating distribution facilities such as warehouses, collection centers, and hybrid warehouse-collection centers and determining the strategy for distributing multiple products between the clients of the 3PLs and the customers via the distribution facilities.

We find that if product substitution is ignored returns policy may greatly harm the manufacturer in situations which we call returns policy trap. In such situations, when buy-back price exceeds certain threshold called trap price, the retailer's best order quantity of the considered product drops sharply to zero, which means that the manufacturer may lose all orders. We also find that in returns policy trap all orders shift to substitute's manufacturer. When the product is easier to be substituted for or target service level is lower, the trap price is lower and the manufacturer faces more danger when using returns policy.",Competitive supply chain; Product substitution; Returns policy; Returns policy trap,Management science; Manufacture; Supply chains; Competitive supply chain; Order quantities; Product substitution; Returns policy; Returns policy trap; Substitutable products; Target services; Supply chain management,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-61849131553

As cost pressures continue to mount in the competitive logistics industry, a growing number of third-party logistics providers (3PLs) have begun to explore the possibility of managing product returns in a more cost-efficient manner. However, few studies have addressed the problem of determining the number and location of repair facilities where returned products from retailers or end-customers were inspected, repaired, and refurbished for redistribution. To fill the void in such a line of research, this paper proposes a mixed-integer programming model and a genetic algorithm that can solve the reverse logistics problem involving the location and allocation of repair facilities for 3PLs. The usefulness of the proposed model and algorithm was validated by its application to an illustrative example encountering 3PLs offering value-added services. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The novel aspect and main advantage of the extended model is an integrated consideration of hydrological processes, vegetation dynamics and biogeochemical cycles (soil carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen) in semi-closed systems (river basins) under environmental change. Thereby the extension was designed to integrate present-day understanding of soil organic matter dynamics under the constraints of data availability for parameterisation at the regional scale. A major advantage is less data and parameter necessary to run the model compared to state of the art SOC models and the availability of direct measurements of soil C carbon contents to test and validate the model. The model extension was tested regarding primary organic matter decomposition and long-term SOC dynamics using observed data sets. This test delivered similar quality as other SOC models. The new SOC model extension adequately represents these processes when compared to observed data on experimental field sites and literature studies. Application of the extended model to assess impacts of land management practices (different organic and inorganic fertilisation schemes, different crop rotations, inclusion of cover crops and harvest by-product returns) on long-term SOC dynamics is presented here at the experimental field and river basin scale. The simulated quantification at the field scale of different fertilisation regimes led to changes from -0.13 to +0.1 t C ha-1 year-1 in SOC, different types of crop rotations and cover crop impacts changed SOC between -0.13 and +0.07 t C ha-1 year-1 and incorporation of harvest by-products (grain straw residuals) led to changes between -0.1 and +0.027 t C ha-1 year-1 in SOC. It is shown on the river basin scale that harvest by-products quantity remaining on the field significantly impact regional SOC dynamics (loss of 0.26 t C ha-1 year-1 when exporting all harvest by-products). The modelled results are in general agreement with studies reported in literature. The extended model is hence able to quantify the impacts of selected land management practices on long-term SOC dynamics and allows land management practices and their impacts on water availability, water quality, carbon storage in soils, and vegetation growth to be assessed in an integrated way. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Retailers' focus on good customer service and the offering of lenient returns polices has led to the growth in this fraudulent behaviour of customers in returning goods. This paper considers retailer myopia in the context of dishonest customer returns, applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) using a quantitative questionnaire with 535 female consumers. The findings highlight the extent of the behaviour with 50% admitting to partaking in deshopping. The TPB variables can be utilised to manage and prevent deshopping. The results indicate that currently these customers perceive it to be easy to deshop as there are no consequences with the result that such behaviour continues to grow. If retailers were less myopic they would monitor returns more thoroughly and make it less easy for such customers to get away with undesirable deshopping behaviour. The paper makes recommendations for retailers to manage or alter perceived behavioural characteristics for customers, which in turn, would reduce tendencies for dishonesty in customers returning goods for refunds.

Previous research indicates that deshopping is a prevalent and growing consumer behaviour. This paper seeks to examine deshopping from a retail perspective. It is a case study of interviews conducted with a mass-market retailer, to investigate their awareness and management of this behaviour. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is a case study of nine interviews conducted with different levels of staff at a mass-market retailer in their flagship London store, to investigate their awareness and management of deshopping. Findings - The findings demonstrate the beliefs, attitudes and emotions of the different levels of employees towards deshopping and demonstrate their attempts to manage deshopping and combat the negative affects of this on customer service. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this research is that it is only conducted with one high-street retailer. However, it is important to highlight that this is a large women's wear retailer which is highly representative of other retailers within the sector. There is little detail given regarding the retailer itself or their fundamentals of the actual customer service policy; this is due to the confidentiality agreement between the researcher and retailer. It is important to acknowledge the sensitivity of this type of research to retailers who are reluctant to have this information publicised. It is also important to acknowledge that many retailers have not made any attempts to manage this behaviour by restricting their returns policy. So, this research case study is conducted with a retailer that is actively introducing change to manage this behaviour. Practical implications - The research concludes with the implications of deshopping and its management and makes recommendations on how to reduce deshopping whilst maintaining customer service for the genuine consumer. Originality/value - This is the first case study with a mass-market retailer, highlighting their approaches towards managing deshopping whilst trying to maintain customer service. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Consumer behaviour; Consumption; Customer service management; Fraud; Product management,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547506374

Few studies have attempted to integrate the forward and reverse distributions.

This paper first develops a multiobjective model considering activities of the 3PLs for forward and reverse distributions simultaneously. Two objectives are included in the proposed model: (a) maximization of the returned products shipped from customers back to the collection faculties and (b) minimization of the total costs associated with the forward and reverse logistics operations. A fuzzy goal programming approach is applied to determine the compromise solution for the multiobjective model. A genetic algorithm with two subalgorithms is then developed to solve the problem.

A key element in reducing uncertainties in the different stages of the reverse channel of a supply chain is access to accurate and timely information on the status, location, and condition of products moving about in the supply chain. It is imperative that firms operating in the reverse supply-chain channels collaborate to integrate and share information in a timely fashion.

In real time situations, the collection of end-of-life (EoL) products from the customer and their return to the manufacturer is tedious and time consuming. Reduced product life cycles have increased the rate of product returns and disposals. Owing to shortened product economic life cycles, the recovery of value from EoL products is becoming a necessity. Companies have realised the value that they could recover by remanufacturing or recycling EoL products.

First, within certain range of demand uncertainty, the return policy is win-win for manufacturers and retailers, and improves efficiency of the whole supply chain. As the intensity of competition increases, the win-win range becomes more robust. By contrast, monopoly supply chain is impossible. On the other hand, when the uncertainty is less than another boundary, manufacturers have strong motivation for the returns policies. We demonstrate that in general, returns policies intensify the competition among retailers, however, within some range of demand uncertainty, returns policies mitigate the competition among manufacturers and otherwise, intensify the competition among manufacturers which leads to a decrease in wholesale price.

Typically, the failure distribution and its parameters are determined using product manufacturing data for each month of production and the corresponding monthly failure counts derived from the warranty claims. If the data is collected systematically, the product ages at the times of failure can be derived. Classical methods are then used to determine the failure time distribution and parameters. However, our experience shows that, in many cases, it may not be possible to know the failure ages of components. The information available each month might be limited to the volume of shipments and total claims or product returns. In such cases, the data hides the component age at the time of failure. In this paper, we show that when the failure history information is incomplete, the failure distribution of the product can be determined using Bayesian analysis techniques applicable for handling incomplete data. We apply the popular Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to find the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) of the failure distribution parameters using incomplete data. The effectiveness of the EM algorithm is compared using several sets of incomplete warranty data generated using simulation. We observed that the EM algorithm is powerful in capturing the hidden failure patterns from the incomplete warranty data. © 2008 IEEE.",Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm; Incomplete data; Sales volume; Warranty claims,Failure (mechanical); Maintainability; Manufacture; Maximum likelihood estimation; Maximum principle; Expectation-maximization algorithms; Failure characteristics; Failure-time distribution; Incomplete data; Maximum likelihood estimate; Product manufacturing; Sales volume; Warranty claims; Data handling,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650299179

The disassembly and recovery operations can be either performed before hand, or upon customer arrival. In the latter case, a discount on the selling price is applied to compensate the customer for waiting for the completion of the disassembly and recovery operations. One of the difficulties faced in planning for such a system is the determination of the opportunity cost associated with carrying recovered parts inventory. The difficulty arises in seeking the value added to the part given the costs incurred for maintaining the product return, disassembly and recovery costs and revenue earned from the hulk, that is the remaining product after the disassembly of the part.

Generally, the quality of biological control agents is determined by field performance because end users may have minimal knowledge pertaining to the condition of biological control agents before application. This study assessed the variability in quality of commercially available EPN products. The authors evaluated preapplication survival of five EPN formulations, Steinernema feltiae (NemaShield, Nemasys, Gnat Not, Horticultural Scanmask), and Heterorhabditis indica (GrubStake-Hi), based on eight shipments/samples of each EPN product received during a 5-month period (July to November). The estimated total number of EPN delivered per shipment (i.e., sample) was compared with the expected quantity listed on the label, and percent live EPN was determined for each shipment. One-half of the shipments of Gnat Not (four of eight) contained 40% to 70% of the number of EPN expected based on the label (25 million). The remaining shipments contained consistently higher numbers, with 99% of the expected quantity of EPN received. Entomopathogenic nematode mean percent survival was highest for Nemasys (98%) and lowest for Horticultural Scanmask (56%). The overall mean percent survival for Gnat Not and GrubStake-Hi, both from the same supplier, was more than 85%. Survival of EPN in the NemaShield product was as low as 50%, but was typically between 65% and 75%. NemaShield and Nemasys were the only two EPN products that provided return policy information if the product was damaged in any way. It is important for distributors and suppliers to ensure that EPN products are in quality condition before shipping to avoid performance failures and loss of customers. In addition, end users need to evaluate shipments upon receipt to determine the viability of EPN products.",Biological control; Formulation; Infective juveniles; Pest management; Survival,Heterorhabditis indica; Nematoda; Steinernema feltiae,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249076484

One of the most effective ways to achieve this level of differentiation is through the development of User Interfaces (UIs) which can differ throughout the product line and across multiple regions. However, the UI development process is often fraught with difficulty. Traditional development techniques often make it extremely difficult to develop, simulate and test new interfaces to the levels of robustness required at the speed the digital receiver market requires. Implementing a new graphical design for a new or legacy application demands a critical amount of precious engineering resource both for development and testing. In order to support manufacturers who need to create differentiated UIs within short product development timescales, Cabot Communications have developed a SVG processing module that interacts with Cabot's more traditional C++ based UI Framework. The features of the SVG processing module enable visual UI changes to be made by graphical designers instead of software engineers, effectively freeing up precious engineering resources. SVG provides a mechanism that is reusable and requires less engineering resource for any future UI iterations, negating the need for reprogramming for differentiated UIs, and allowing mission critical robust functionality to be maintained in C++. The development of a SVG support module enables the implementation of skinnable applications, where the definition of the look and feel of the UI has been separated from the application code. This provides a mechanism which allows the UI to be designed independently and for production engineers to use and deploy the new design very quickly; as it enables only the completeness and usability of the new look and feel to be tested, independently of existing underlying product functionality. The SVG processing module liberates design creativity by enabling esthetic graphical drawings defined by SVG instead of the traditional method which could only accept small images suitable for embedded systems. With SVG, manufacturers are able to provide new UI designs and their SVG definitions so that they can be easily integrated to applications with minimal time and effort. In addition, SVG enables graphical designers to easily see how their design looks on the resultant application through Cabot's dynamic PC based SVG simulator which provides an instant UI visualization, allowing greater experimentation. Cabot has developed a SVG engine that processes a subset of SVG Profile Basic 1.1. The SVG elements that are supported by our SVG engine are line, rectangle, circle, ellipse, polygon, polyline, path and linked images. In DVB UIs, we commonly need widgets, such as buttons, text boxes, selection boxes, list boxes, scrollbars, etc. We have also developed C++ widget classes that can process and use the graphical designs defined by SVG. Each skinnable UI dialog and widget type has corresponding SVG files that describe their graphical, scallable, and positional aspects for each state that they may be in. Hence a SVG file describing a dialog is a template, containing the background visual appearance and the size and position of any widgets or optional elements. Simple id fields are used to identify SVG elements to the C++ implementation, where the application functionality resides. To summarise, we feel that SVG provides our customers with a number of competitive advantages: • Flexibility: Commercial graphical tools support SVG for complete flexibility in creating customised UIs • Efficiency: SVG enables UIs to be easily created and modified without the constraints of traditional UI development tools which require engineering time and effort. In addition, greater re-use is encouraged. • Quality: The perceived quality of the UI is greatly enhanced when graphical design experts are used • Liberates existing applications: Tested legacy applications can be deployed to different customers with ease. • Hardware independence: The entire application can be developed within a PC environment before being moved to the receiver hardware • Complete UI reassurance: Enhanced SVG features dramatically reduce the possibility of UI problems once the product has been deployed, resulting in optimal consumer satisfaction and reduced support calls and product returns • Cost effective: The benefits delivered by SVG enable manufacturers to reduce the development costs and engineering effort required to make differentiated UIs • Increased speed to market: The features provided by SVG enable customised UIs to be built, simulated and tested in previously unachievable time scales Cabot's future plans include extending our SVG processing module to include more SVG features, in order to enable designers to develop even more compelling UIs.",,Commerce; Competition; Computer software reusability; Engineering; Engines; Hardware; Manufacture; Product design; Product development; Production engineering; User interfaces; Application codes; Competitive advantage; Consumer satisfactions; Cost effective; Critical amount; Design creativities; Development and testing; Development costs; Development process; Development technique; Development tools; Differentiated products; Digital receivers; Engineering resources; Engineering time; Graphical designs; Graphical tools; Key elements; Legacy applications; Market advantages; Mission critical; Multiple regions; New design; PC-based; Perceived quality; Polyline; Processing modules; Product differentiation; Product returns; Product-lines; Production engineers; Size and position; Software engineers; Speed-to-market; Support modules; Time-scales; UI designs; Visual appearance; Cost engineering,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874322501

The contract considers stochastic and price-dependent demand. We present an analytical model and then use numerical methods with the Stackelberg game to identify the contract properties. We numerically show that a returns policy indeed improves supply chain performance. However, the benefits earned from the returns policy, under price-sensitive and variable demand, are different for different supply chain partners. First, when price-sensitivity is high, profit of the manufacturer decreases with increase in demand variability. Second, when price-sensitivity is sufficiently high and demand variability increases, the manufacturer has to surrender part of the profits to the retailer, in order to continue sales. However, even after surrendering part of the profits to the retailer, the manufacturer still earns profits that are higher than those available in a wholesale price contract. Last, from the perspective of division of channel profits, the retailer is always worse off in case of returns policies than in a wholesale price contract. Therefore, to apply this form of incentive in practice, managements should consider the impact of price-sensitivity on the returns policy and its performance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we consider a multi-item returns policy called ""pooled"" (or joint) returns policy under which the distributor can return any combination of the products up to R percent of the total purchases across all products. We analyze the distributor's optimal profit and order quantity under the pooled returns policy, and compare these operating characteristics to the case when a single-item ""non-pooled"" returns policy is instituted. Under the non-pooled returns policy, the distributor can only return on individual items using item-specific return limits. We show an intuitive result that the distributor will always achieve a higher profit under the pooled policy. However, the manufacturer could actually obtain a lower profit under the pooled policy due to a counter-intuitive result: the distributor may order less under the pooled policy even though the pooled policy offers more flexibility. This counter-intuitive result motivates us to determine the conditions under which the distributor would order less under the pooled policy. Finally, we develop a heuristic for determining the distributor's optimal order quantities associated with the n-product case under the pooled policy. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Each endpoint can have associated policies which are used to define constraints on which subjects are permitted to call which targets, and what is permitted to be transferred between subjects and targets. Subject-based policies aim to protect the subject from untrusted targets, while target-based policies aim to protect the target from unauthorised subjects.

The results of an experiment involving 164 adult consumers revealed that the time allowed for product return had a positive impact on retailer's image and a negative impact on the felt need for additional information. In addition, RPGPs allowing a money refund led to a more positive retailer's image. Contrary to expectations, the characteristics of RPGPs did not have an influence on the perception of product quality. Financial risk was a significant moderator of the relationship between the terms of the RPGP and retailer's image and of the relationship between the length allowed for returning the product and the need for additional information, but it did not moderate the other relationships. Product complexity moderated the relationship between length of time and the need for more information but had no moderating impact on the other relationships.

An inventory decision problem with two replenishment channels including the forward channel and the remanufacturing channel was proposed. Under the assumption that the return payment price influences the probability of product return, a stochastic inventory model with dependent return and demand was given. The optimal decision problem about the replenishment quantity of the forward channel and return payment price was studied in order to maximize the expectation profit of the system.

This paper theorizes that it should and finds that it does because the PD projects undertaken are usually an expression of the strategic type of the firm. The purpose of this research is to affirm a 1996 survey of members of the Product Development & Management Association (PDMA) that proposes that firms' PD performance measures should vary by their strategic type. Thus, for example, prospectors, the strategic type most likely to introduce new products to new markets, should place greater importance on PD success measures consistent with their characteristic strategies of changing product lines and early market entry. In contrast, defenders, the strategic type most likely to maintain stable product lines for existing markets, should place greater importance on PD success measures consistent with their characteristic strategies of stable product lines and market penetration. Analyzers, a hybrid type between prospectors and defenders, should prefer measures consistent with their characteristic strategies for improving products and being early followers in newer markets. To relate strategic types to specific success measures for PD projects, this paper proposes a model of the relationship based on the degree of project newness to the firm and then catalogs measures of PD project success and groups them according to degree of project newness. The research findings are based on survey responses from 222 individuals who are employed by financial service providers, who identified their firms by strategic type and rated the importance of PD success measures to their firms. The importance of 21 performance measures is compared by strategic type to find significant differences among prospectors, analyzers, and defenders. This research finds several significant relationships. prospectors, for example, attach greater importance to customer satisfaction, launch timeliness, and product return on investment, all of which may be characterized as relating to a higher degree of project newness to the firm. defenders and analyzers, on the other hand, attach more importance than prospectors to measures of unit volume, cost reduction, and margin goals, all of which relate to a lower degree of project newness to the firm. In short, because prospectors seek to introduce new products to new markets, they consider important those measures, which accord with greater product and market newness. The major conclusion of this paper is that strategic type affects the importance of project performance measures and that all firms should not use the same success measures. Firms should contextualize their success in PD projects based on their strategic type. This conclusion resonates with previous findings that strategy is a key determinant of PD success, though it is infrequently included in PD success studies. This paper, therefore, challenges the implicit assumption in the mainstream of PD success literature that success can be determined without regard to firm strategy. © 2009 Product Development & Management Association.",,Customer satisfaction; Paper; Product development; Project management; Surveys; Contextualize; Development projects; Financial Services; Firm strategies; Hybrid types; Key determinants; Market entries; Market penetrations; New products; Performance measures; Product lines; Product returns; Project performances; Project successes; Success measures; Unit volumes; Marketing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57749114604

This paper provides a context for this special edition. It highlights the scale of the challenge of nursing shortages, but also makes the point that there is a policy agenda that provides workable solutions. Results. An overview of nurse:population ratios in different countries and regions of the world, highlighting considerable variations, with Africa and South East Asia having the lowest average ratios. The paper argues that the 'shortage' of nurses is not necessarily a shortage of individuals with nursing qualifications, it is a shortage of nurses willing to work in the present conditions. The causes of shortages are multi-faceted, and there is no single global measure of their extent and nature, there is growing evidence of the impact of relatively low staffing levels on health care delivery and outcomes. The main causes of nursing shortages are highlighted: inadequate workforce planning and allocation mechanisms, resource constrained undersupply of new staff, poor recruitment, retention and 'return' policies, and ineffective use of available nursing resources through inappropriate skill mix and utilisation, poor incentive structures and inadequate career support. Conclusions. What now faces policy makers in Japan, Europe and other developed countries is a policy agenda with a core of common themes. First, themes related to addressing supply side issues: getting, keeping and keeping in touch with relatively scarce nurses. Second, themes related to dealing with demand side challenges. The paper concludes that the main challenge for policy makers is to develop a co-ordinated package of policies that provide a long term and sustainable solution. Relevance to clinical practice. This paper highlights the impact that nursing shortages has on clinical practice and in health service delivery. It outlines scope for addressing shortage problems and therefore for providing a more positive staffing environment in which clinical practice can be delivered. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Nurses; Nursing; Workforce issues; Workforce planning,Health Priorities; Nurses; Planning Techniques; Policy Making; World Health; article; health; health care planning; management; nurse; organization and management,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-56149110028

Design/methodology/approach - A bi-level optimization model is developed to determine the disposition decision for refrigerators, washing machines and passenger cars in the Indian context using data for product returns from literature. Using standard off-the-shelf software, the break-even values of returns are calculated for setting up various VR facilities under different scenarios to maximize profits for a ten-year time-horizon. Findings - The VR activities are profitable for all the three categories of products beyond a certain minimum quantity of returns. Experimentation across the three product categories shows that presently remanufacturing is not a viable economic proposition in the Indian context. Further, the VR network design suggested by this approach is volume flexible. Research limitations/implications - A ""push"" system where the volumes and grades of returns drive the VR decisions. Optimization has been carried out for three product categories and not brands or OEMs. No free choice of facility locations. Practical implications - The insights and learning under different scenarios may be utilized as inputs for decision-making and for designing various incentive plans. Originality/value - This work is a first step towards VR network design in the Indian context.

The manager decides which product returns to accept for processing at the remanufacturing facility, and which ones to sell immediately as-is at a salvage value. High congestion levels in the remanufacturing facility delay the sale of the remanufactured product at the secondary market, decreasing the value at which it can be sold; this may imply a more attractive salvaging option. This is particularly important for high-tech products with short life cycles, such as computers and printers. We propose a two-step policy. In the first step, the returned product's random processing time is observed. In the second step, a disposition decision is made: if the processing time is larger than a threshold k* the product is salvaged; otherwise the product is remanufactured. We provide an approximate procedure to compute k* in industrial settings. Our numerical study demonstrates the superiority of our policy over the current industrial practice ignoring the time value of money. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.",Closed-loop supply chains; Heuristics; Queuing; Remanufacturing; Time-value,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449429205

SMEs often have tight budgets and are vulnerable to risk. It is usually assumed in research about supply chain contracts that supply chain members have sufficient capital and can thus determine their inventory policies to maximize expected profits. However, when facing varying demands, SMEs may not survive the period with an unexpected decrease of demand if ordering as a well-established company. They should have a different objective, i.e. to maximize the probability of their long-term survival. This research studies a two-echelon supply chain with a retailer struggling for survival and a well-established supplier offering a returns policy or a linear rebate. The ordering behaviour of the retailer with an objective to maximize his survival probability and its impact on the supplier's profitability are addressed. We further compare returns policies and linear rebates with wholesale-price-only contracts. It is found that a returns policy does not change the retailer's ordering behaviour and that a linear rebate contract can help to increase the retailer's survival probability. In the short-term view, offering a linear rebate to the retailer as an objective to maximize the survival probability, results in the decrease of the supplier's expected profit. Whereas, in the long-term view, suppliers may offer linear rebates to the retailer, hoping to make a greater profit in future. © ASCE.",Inventory policy; Linear rebate; Returns policy; Survival probability maximization,International trade; Inventory control; Logistics; Profitability; Risk perception; Sales; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Expected profits; Global market; Inventory policies; Inventory policy; Linear rebate; Research studies; Returns policies; Returns policy; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Supply chain contracts; Supply contracts; Survival probabilities; Survival probability maximization; Two-echelon supply chain; Probability,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70249132937

Policy gradient methods try to accomplish this goal by directly approximating the policy using a parametric function approximator; the expected return of the current policy is estimated and its parameters are updated by steepest ascent in the direction of the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters. In general, the policy is defined in terms of a set of basis functions that capture important features of the problem. Since the quality of the resulting policies directly depend on the set of basis functions, and defining them gets harder as the complexity of the problem increases, it is important to be able to find them automatically. In this paper, we propose a new approach which uses cascade-correlation learning architecture for automatically constructing a set of basis functions within the context of Natural Actor-Critic (NAC) algorithms. Such basis functions allow more complex policies be represented, and consequently improve the performance of the resulting policies. We also present the effectiveness of the method empirically. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",,Education; Functions; Gradient methods; Probability density function; Reinforcement; Reinforcement learning; Actor critic; Basis functions; Correlation learning; Function approximator; New approaches; Policy gradient methods; Learning algorithms,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-58449097347

Each stage is a stocking point holding some form of inventory (e.g., raw materials, subassemblies, product returns or finished products) that after a suitable transformation can satisfy customer demand. Stocking decisions are made before demand occurs. Because of delays, only a known fraction of demand at a stage will wait for shipments. Unsatisfied demand is lost. The revenue, salvage value, ordering, shipping, processing, and lost sales costs are proportional. There are fixed costs for utilizing stages for stock storage. After characterizing an optimal solution, we propose an algorithm for its computation. For the zero fixed cost case, the computations can be done on a spreadsheet given normal demands.

Our recent study, extensive discussions with executives, and on-site visits suggest that this wisdom may not be complete for certain industries or products. Customers on average return about 6% of everything they buy. Companies need to view this as an opportunity to give this returns pile a new lease of life. Yet many companies are not used to thinking that the things they expel such as products, waste, and resources actually have value. In fact, few retailers and suppliers capture the wealth of information that is locked inside a box that has been returned to the warehouse. Elevating the returns process to a new marketing opportunity builds a loyal customer base and also attracts new ones. In this paper, we present a redefined value chain strategy that entails a closed-loop system for industries in which reverse chain activities (reuse, repair, refurbishing, recycling, remanufacturing, or redesign of returned products from the end user) may create additional competitive advantages for the firm. Firms that do not recognize the importance of an effective reverse logistics strategy as part of their value chain risk damaging customer relations and may seriously jeopardize their brand image and reputation. A good reverse logistics program can be a differentiator and provides a means of gaining market advantage. In our perspective, a redefined value chain should be a part of the overall business strategy for manufacturers or retailers who handle product returns.

The value of commercial product returns, which we define as products returned for any reason within 90 days of sale, now exceeds $100 billion annually in the United States. Although the reverse supply chain of returned products represents a sizeable flow of potentially recoverable assets, only a relatively small fraction of the value is currently extracted by manufacturers; a large proportion of the product value erodes away because of long processing delays. Thus, there are significant opportunities to build competitive advantage from making the appropriate reverse supply chain design choices. In this paper, we present a network flow with delay models that includes the marginal value of time to identify the drivers of reverse supply chain design.

Returned products arriving before the end of the selling season can be resold if there is sufficient demand. A single order is placed before the season starts. Excess inventory at the end of the season is salvaged and all demands not met directly are lost. Since little historical information is available, it is impossible to determine the shape of the distribution of demand. Therefore, we analyze the distribution-free newsboy problem with returns, in which only the mean and variance of demand are assumed to be known. We derive a simple closed-form expression for the distribution-free order quantity, which we compare to the optimal order quantities when gross demand is assumed to be normal, lognormal or uniform.

When remanufacturing is feasible, the longer the return flows are delayed during the active (primary) market demand period of the product, the lower the value that can be recovered through these operations. In fact, in order to recover the highest value from remanufactured products, the collection rates, return timings, and reusability rates should be matched with the active market demand and supply. With these motivations, this paper is aimed at developing analytical models for the efficient use of returns in making production, inventory, and remanufacturing decisions during the active market. More specifically, we consider a stylistic setting where a collector collects used product returns and ships them to the manufacturer who, in turn, recovers value by remanufacturing and supplies products during the active market demand. Naturally, the manufacturer's production, inventory and remanufacturing decisions and costs are influenced by the timing and quantity of the collector's shipments of used product returns. Hence, we investigate the impact of the timing of returns on the profitability of the manufacturer-collector pair by developing system-wide cost optimization models. Analyzing the properties of the optimal shipment frequency, we observe that the fastest reverse supply chain may not always be the most efficient one. © 2006 Production and Operations Management Society.",Inventory control; Life cycle; Product returns; Remanufacturing,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846325280

Rather than ignore the risk attitude of the retailer and manufacturer, this paper relaxes this assumption and constructs a general returns model through the expected utility approach. An inventory theoretic model is developed and a menu of discount-return combinations is designed for the feasible solutions of a wholesale price discount and buyback price. It is shown that the decision to join a returns contact considerably depends on the utility functions for both the retailer and manufacturer. That is, the risk attitude is a core factor for the retailer and manufacturer to decide if to sign a returns contact, and without considering the factor in the model, the decision may be biased.",Inventory model; Return policy; Risk management; Utility theory,Competitive intelligence; Costs; Mathematical models; Public policy; Strategic planning; Theorem proving; Inventory model; Return policy; Risk-neutral; Utility theory; Risk management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746835311

The operational decision of interest in matching supply with demand is the quantity of new product to order. Our objective is to evaluate the VOI from reducing one or more types of uncertainties, where value is measured by the reduction in total expected holding and shortage costs. We start with a single period model with normally distributed demands and returns, and restrict the analysis to the value of full information (VOFI) on one or more types of uncertainty. We develop estimators that are predictive of the value and sensitivity of (combinations of) different information types. We find that there is no dominance in value amongst the different types of information, and that there is an additional pay-off from investing in more than one type. We then extend our analysis to the multi-period case, where returns in a period are correlated with demands in the previous period, and study the value of partial information (VOPI) as well as full information. We demonstrate that our results from the single period model (adapted for VOPI) carry-over exactly. Furthermore, a comparison with uniformly distributed demand and return show that these results are robust with respect to distributional assumptions. © 2006 Production and Operations Management Society.",Inventory control; Supply chain management; Value of information,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846273817

The uncertain production lead-times are considered as random grey variables. The proposed random grey simulation methodology can generate input-output data for the uncertain functions. The designed neural network trained from input-output data can expedite the simulation process of the uncertain functions. The hybrid intelligent optimization algorithm integrating the random grey simulation, neural network and genetic algorithm can optimize the inventory model. The numerical analysis result indicates that the average cost increases with increasing of both the given customer service level and the average manufacturing leadtime. This result coincides with the actual situation of inventory system.

Design/methodology/approach - A review of the applied literature of reverse logistics and its effects on CRM resulted in a basic model and empirical verification of such effects. Findings - As shown from the empirical section of the present study (n = 102), the ease of locating returns procedures and the rating given by respondents to the overall returns process were found to be statistically very significant regarding whether the ease of returning items had an influence on purchasing decisions for most respondents. As demonstrated in the results of stepwise regression analysis of the two independent variables, the largest share of explained variance was explained by the variable, Returns' Procedures. Research limitations/implications - The purpose of reverse logistics is to accommodate customers wanting to return items and how to account for such accommodations. The breakdown, process, and analysis of reverse logistics will portray the significance of having reverse logistics implemented within a marketing or strategic plan. Practical implications - This paper describes reverse logistics and CRM within a knowledge-based system and its implementation process in an academic manner. Hence, there should be a process in place and managers should work to master reserve logistical processes to promote the principles of CRM properly. To remain competitive, firms must develop reverse logistics systems that rival traditional systems in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, competitiveness, and customer satisfaction. Originality/value - Many companies and small businesses do not think about the importance and impact of reverse logistics and therefore do not include reverse logistics in their strategic or marketing plan. There are several important aspects of reverse logistics that need to be utilized in every company that exploit and track return policies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Distribution management; Relationship marketing; Resources; Supply chain management,Commerce; Competition; Customer satisfaction; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Public relations; Supply chain management; Customer relation management; Design/methodology/approach; Distribution management; Implementation process; Independent variables; Relationship marketing; Resources; Stepwise regression analysis; Logistics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27744607357

Specifically, doubts remain both about the conditions and voluntariness of return, the ability of individual returnees to reintegrate in their home countries and regions, and the wider sustainability of the return process. This paper seeks to provide an overview of recent policy interest in returns, before setting out a tentative definition of what might be considered a ""sustainable"" return. It is argued that it is possible to draw a distinction between narrow indicators of the ""sustainability"" of return, such as whether returnees subsequently reemigrate, and wider definitions, which see ""sustainability"" as involving both the reintegration of individual returnees in their home societies, and the wider impact of return on macroeconomic and political indicators. Based on either definition, the development of robust indicators of the sustainability of return could assist in monitoring the impact of return programmes, providing valuable insight on return policies. The broader definition suggested also draws attention to the idea that continued mobility after an initial return - including circulation and the development of a ""transnational"" lifestyle - may be more ""sustainable"" than a single and definitive return to the refugee's place of origin. © 2006 IOM.",,macroeconomics; mobility; policy development; refugee; return migration; sustainability,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746447209

Due to the difference and interaction between the forward and reverse distribution, how to integrate the forward and reverse channels has become an emerging issue. Many companies currently only have very inefficient, slow and expensive processes for handling returned products. They are either incapable or unwilling to enter the reverse logistics market. Thus, more and more companies are increasingly outsourcing their distribution operations to the third party logistics providers (3PLs). In practice, the 3PLs usually serve a number of clients where the operations of multiple products are involved. Thus, the aspect of multiproduct is necessary to be considered in the distribution network design for the 3PLs. However, almost all the existing research in this field merely focus on the separate reverse distribution and homogeneous product. This paper addresses an integrated forward and reverse distributions network design problem for the 3PLs that involves locating distribution facilities such as warehouse, collection center and hybrid warehouse-collection center, and determining the strategy for distributing the multiple products between the clients of the 3PLs and the customers via the distribution facilities. A genetic algorithm (GA) with two greedy algorithms is used for solution purpose. Computational experiments demonstrate a great deal of promise for this solution method, as high-quality solutions are obtained while expending modest computational effort.",Facility location; Genetic algorithm; Multiproduct; Reverse logistics; Third party logistics providers,Genetic algorithms; Industrial engineering; Industry; Location; Warehouses; Computational experiment; Distribution facilities; Distribution operations; Facility locations; Multi-products; Network design problems; Reverse logistics; Third party logistics providers; Logistics,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886895044

In such a supply chain the initial production or key material procurement decision has to be made when there is limited information about the market demand. When it is the time for the final production and/or shipment decision, more accurate demand information is available, which allows the modification of the initial decision so that some costs can be saved. We consider a two-stage supply chain in which the manufacturer decides the initial production quantity in the first stage, and the retailer specifies her order quantity in the second stage after the demand forecast is improved. In this setting, the conventional return mechanism needs to be modified to coordinate the supply chain. We propose a risk sharing contract that requests the retailer to partially compensate for the manufacturer's loss that is attributable to the overproduction in the first stage, and the manufacturer to provide a partial credit for the retailer's loss that results from overstocking in the second stage. Such a contract not only extracts the maximal supply-chain profit, but can also improve the profit of each supply-chain member by tuning the contract parameters. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

But returns also represent an often-missed opportunity to manage customer relationships and build customer loyalty to the retailer. Based upon data from a survey of 464 customers of five different Internet retailers, this article explores how firms' returns management systems affect loyalty intentions. We draw upon extant literature in the fields of Internet retailing, service quality, supply chain management, and customer satisfaction/loyalty to develop a model and a set of hypotheses relating ten latent variables in the service returns offering area. Our resulting structural equation model provides evidence of the impact of the returns management system upon customer loyalty intentions. The model also identifies effects on loyalty intentions arising from customers' satisfaction with, and perceptions of, the value of the returns service offered. These findings will help inform managers' choices regarding investment in the returns management system as an element of service quality improvement and a potential means of improved profitability.

Design/methodology/approach – A system dynamic model has been developed to complement with prior models and is validated using data collected from a computer company manufacturer handling returns with volumes transacted over a period of two years. Findings – The results from the model indicate that part replacements from suppliers are more profitable than refurbished computer parts. In addition, transportation delay and supplier delay in processing returns have a significant impact on the viability of reverse logistics regardless of return volumes. Research limitations/implications – The current model is not designed for third-party logistics (3PL) offering reverse logistics services. However, this can be accomplished by resetting some of the parameters in the model. The other limitations are exchange rate fluctuation and product depreciation which are not incorporated in the model. This is important in Asia where each country has its own currency which fluctuates with time. Practical implications – This dynamic model will assist decision-makers to test new policies related to reverse logistics, for example, liberal versus conservative return policy from supplier, shipment consolidation (longer delays) versus direct shipment, batch (longer delays) versus JIT remanufacturing, pricing of new parts versus re-condition parts, as well as to examine its long-term viability.

By having a device that ensures a clean inner glass surface, which cannot be accessed by end usera without a hard level of disassembly, something not achievable in most of the cases, the outcome there is the potential reduction of product returns due to bad quality of the scanner output. The device itself would be assembled in the scanner module, in contact with the internal surface of the glass. The fact of being assembled on the scanner module, would avoid the need of additional motors that would move the cleaning device back and forth. The movement of the scanner module would be moving die cleaning device as well. This basically means that the scan job and the cleaning cycle would occur simultaneously. Additionally, more cleaning routines can be programmed thru firmware upon designer decision. For instance, a cycle in which the scanner module moves back and forth once a day, after 12 hours being the scanner unused.

The other alternative is to have just one sandwich cleaning device in the scanner module, located before the scanner. The foam located between the two rubbers may be saturated with a window cleaning liquid. In order to keep the foam wet during the whole product life, a reservoir connected to the foam may be considered in the scanner module. A feature on the scanner parking area may be considered as well in order to enable the possibility of refilling the window cleaning liquid reservoir from outside. The purpose of the foam is to dissolve any accumulation of dust or dirtiness that may be more difficult to remove. The nibbers placed at both sides of the foam would be made of a similar sort of material as the one used in the standard window cleaning tools.

In force testing, compressing or pulling on a sample yields an equal and opposite reaction force that helps in force measurement. Effective force testing procedures can capture manufacturing defects soon after they occur, which helps in minimizing costly product returns. Companies adopt a standard for testing how much force is good and how much is bad? After a force standard is adopted, requirements and specifications for the test, and the sample must be gathered and compared against the many models of force testing equipment available. After this information is collected, a force testing system can be configured. A force measurement system consists of force gage, test stand, distance meter, and grips and fixtures.

The supply chain considered here is assumed to have one supplier and one retailer who serves a random demand of a product with a short life cycle. The retailer can return all the unsold products to the supplier with a partial refund. We found that if the retailer behaviour is rational, that is, ordering the optimal quantity to maximize its expected profit, then both retailer and supplier could benefit from the returns policy. Furthermore, we established that the optimal buyback price is independent of the mean of the random demand, but the variance of the demand has a significant impact on setting the optimal buyback price. The higher the variance the higher the optimal buyback price and the larger the profit gain of both parties. Numerical studies are employed to help understand the benefits of returns policies for the supplier, the retailer, and the whole supply chain. © 2007 Operational Research Society Ltd.

In fact, revenue recognition has become one of the hottest areas of investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon a review of literature from the fields of accounting, finance, marketing and management, this article explains the common practices and motivators that trigger improper sales revenue recognition in B-to-B marketing transactions. A model of marketing actions and financial performance is developed that emphasizes the need for expanding firm performance criteria for formulating and implementing marketing strategy tactics, in an effort to control the improper revenue recognition practices. A classification scheme is also developed that broadly categorizes the motivators into four main groups, including those that are primarily triggered by (1) the firm's desire to obtain some favorable resource or response from an external third party, (2) some aspect of the firm's marketing strategy failure and (3) the employee's personal enrichment goals, and (4) the lack of knowledge of the GAAP guidelines. All four groups of the motivators result in misleading the firm's sales revenues, hence are fraudulent in nature. We provide guidelines for curbing the revenue recognition lapses through sales-force training, with an emphasis on ethical rules of conduct for corporate behavior, and the design of marketing strategy formulation and its implementation.

This paper sets out to examine deshopping from a consumer perspective, and to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to demonstrate how this behaviour can be managed and prevented with the help of an accompanied (de)shop. It also seeks to place deshopping within a legal and ethical context, in relation to the established literature in this field. Design/methodology/approach - This paper tests the TPB variables in a qualitative way by conducting in-depth interviews with deshoppers, who had completed a quantitative questionnaire. The results further support and enhance the quantitative TPB results collected previously with 535 consumers. An accompanied (de)shop is also reviewed, as this qualitative research technique, enables an enhanced understanding and evidence of the deshopping process, which has not been demonstrated previously. The findings demonstrate support for these qualitative research tool, which enable a deeper understanding of the deshopping process and its management. Findings - The findings demonstrate important use of the TPB as a qualitative research technique. The model is also expanded and redesigned by adding extra variables as a result of this research. The accompanied (de)shop findings demonstrate support for this qualitative research tool, which also enables a deeper understanding of the deshopping process and its management. Practical implications - The research concludes with the implications of deshopping for the industry and makes recommendations regarding how to reduce deshopping, as well as recommending the qualitative research techniques to be utilised by future researchers. Originality/value - This is the first paper to place deshopping in a legal framework which highlights the legal loopholes in a retailer's returns policy and the implications of new directives which will influence retailers' abilities to refuse a return. This paper is also the first to explore deshopping within an ethical framework that has created new knowledge on the unethical consumer in relation to deshopping behaviour. This study also incorporates an accompanied (de)shop methodology; this form of research has never been undertaken in relation to deshopping activity and has generated completely new knowledge of what is happening when the actual behaviour is taking place. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Consumer behaviour; Consumer psychology; Purchasing techniques; Retail management; Shopping,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744781057

As cost pressures continue to mount in this era of economic downturns, a growing number of firms have begun to explore the possibility of managing product returns in a more cost-efficient manner. However, few studies have addressed the problem of determining the number and location of centralized return centers (i.e., reverse consolidation points) where returned products from retailers or end-customers were collected, sorted, and consolidated into a large shipment destined for manufacturers'; or distributors'; repair facilities. To fill the void in such a line of research, this paper proposes a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model and a genetic algorithm that can solve the reverse logistics problem involving product returns.

From the firm's point of view, a generous return policy will increase sales revenue, but will also increase cost due to increased likelihood of return. Design quality of the product has been used as a competitive weapon for a long time. This paper recognizes the relationship between design quality and price of the product, and the firm's return policy. Quality level in the product would influence the amount of return directly. When the product quality is higher, the customer satisfaction rate will increase and the probability of return will decrease. We develop a profit-maximization model to jointly obtain optimal policies for the product quality level, price and the return policy over time.

Unlike the prior literature, however, we assume that both supplier and retailer have limited and stochastic salvage capacities. We first analyze the case of integrated supply chain in which the agents' decisions are fully coordinated for the joint profits. The result prescribes a partial returns policy, in which the retailer returns a part of the leftovers to the supplier and liquidates the remainder through its clearance sale. In a decentralized system, the supplier should motivate the retailer to duplicate the outcome of the integrated system in choosing order and returns quantities. We propose three coordination contracts, of which each uses two benefit transfer schemes as an incentive to the retailer, instead of using a single benefit scheme as in the prior literature. All three effectively coordinate the supply chain.

The problem is described with a game theory structure: The manufacturer, as the Stackelberg leader, first commits a returns price to the retailers under a given wholesale price. Upon receiving this information, two competing retailers, as followers, make decisions for their retail price and order size, in which the process of pricing and ordering is played as Nash equilibrium. Anticipated the retailers responses, the manufacturer designs his returns policy. Adopting the classic newsboy problem model framework and using numerical study methods, the study finds that the provision of a returns policy is dependent on the market conditions faced by the retailers. The paper also analyses the impact of demand variability on the decisions of optimal retail price and order quantity and profit reallocation between the manufacturer and the retailers.

The objective is to determine those lot sizes for manufacturing and remanufacturing that minimize the total cost composed of holding cost for returns and (re)manufactured products and set-up costs. Two different set-up cost schemes are considered: there is either a joint set-up cost for manufacturing and remanufacturing (single production line) or separate set-up costs (dedicated production lines). For the joint set-up cost case, we present an exact, polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm. For both cases, we suggest modifications of the well-known Silver Meal (SM), Least Unit Cost (LUC) and Part Period Balancing (PPB) heuristics. An extensive numerical study reveals a number of insights. The key ones are that, under both set-up cost schemes: (1) the SM and LUC heuristics perform much better than PPB, (2) increased variation in the demand amounts can lead to reduced cost, showing that predictability is more important than variation, and (3) periods with more returns than demand should, if possible, be avoided by 'matching demand and return.",Batch sizing; Inventory; Remanufacturing; Reverse logistics,Costs; Dynamic programming; Heuristic methods; Inventory control; Logistics; Optimization; Polynomials; Strategic planning; Inventory; Part Period Balancing (PPB); Remanufacturing; Reverse logistics; Production engineering,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748479670

EPR typically involves requiring that producers take back their products at the end of their useful lives, or pay a recycling contractor to do so, thereby internalizing the costs of recycling or disposal in a manufacturer's bottom line. When companies know that they will bear the costs of product return and recycling, they are more likely to redesign their products for easier and safer handling at each step in the life cycle. This approach ""enforces a design strategy that takes into account the upstream environmental impacts inherent in the selection, mining and extraction of materials, the health and environmental impacts to workers and surrounding communities during the production process itself, and downstream impacts during use, recycling and disposal of the products"" (EPR Working Group 2003, 2). In short, by requiring a company to take its products back, EPR aims to force the company to make the products cleaner in the first place. The idea of applying EPR policy to electronics arrived in the United States in the 1990s as a welcome import from Europe. This chapter traces EPR's adoption by coalitions of U.S. environmental, labor, and health activists seeking a comprehensive policy solution to the health and safety threats posed by the high-technology industry's internationalization. © 2006 by The Temple University Press.

The focus of this paper is on the latter. We analyze an inventory system with unit product returns and demands where remanufacturing is the cheaper alternative for manufacturing. Manufacturing is also needed, however, since there are less returns than demands. The cost structure consists of setup costs, holding costs, and backorder costs. Manufacturing and remanufacturing orders have non-zero lead times. To control the system we use certain extensions of the familiar (s, Q) policy, called push and pull remanufacturing policies. For all policies we present simple, closed form formulae for approximating the optimal policy parameters under a cost minimization objective.

Customers like the convenience, but sacrifice the benefit of physical inspection of the product increasing the probability of dissatisfaction and the likelihood of return. Many internet sellers have problems offering a clear return policy and ease of return. Basically, they design their supply chain more for the fulfillment rather that the reverse logistics. Much can be gained by the seller by way of increased sales, if they could offer an easy return policy. The trade-off here is in the increase in the cost. The profit function increases with the generosity of the return policy because the sales increases, but decreases as the cost increases. A model for obtaining the optimum return policy in conjunction with the optimum pricing policy giving the optimal strategy would be very useful. A profit-maximization model to obtain optimal return policy including price as a decision variable is presented in this paper.

Accurate sales forecasting is certainly an inexpensive way to meet the aforementioned goals, since this leads to improved customer service, reduced lost sales and product returns and more efficient production planning. Especially for the food industry, successful sales forecasting systems can be very beneficial, due to the short shelf-life of many food products and the importance of the product quality which is closely related to human health. In this paper we present a complete framework that can be used for developing nonlinear time series sales forecasting models.

Each supplier can improve his performance by offering a return policy to the assembler while the best contract depends on that offered by the other supplier. We show that the non-cooperative contracts game between the firms has a unique and stable equilibrium in which the optimal return policies happen to fully coordinate the whole channel. Moreover, the suppliers still have the rights to negotiate with the assembler independently to share their profits properly.

As cost pressures continue to mount in this era of economic downturns, a growing number of firms have begun to explore the possibility of managing product returns in a more cost-efficient manner. Therefore, this work addresses the problem of routes designing of distribution and collection network in order to provide an efficient method to manage the transportation cost. We treat this problem as the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (VRP-sPD). The VRP-sPD model is the problem of optimal integrating goods distribution and collection with minimum transportation costs, when the operations must be performed at the same time by a fleet of homogenous vehicles. The vehicle routing problem has been shown to be a NP-hard problem. To fill the void in such a line of research, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm approach that can solve the logistics problem involving goods returns. Genetic algorithm (GA) is an excellent approach to solving complex problems in optimization with difficult constraints. In this paper, we present the decision processes for solving the VRP-sPD, which comprise the construction heuristic and genetic algorithm (GA), and report on our computational experience. First, we cluster the customers by heuristic algorithm. Second, we use GA to determine the routes of the simultaneous pickup and delivery services. The effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm are validated by its application to an illustrative example dealing with goods distribution and collection.",Genetic algorithm; Reverse logistics; Vehicle routing problem,Complex networks; Computational complexity; Fleet operations; Heuristic algorithms; Industrial engineering; Logistics; Network routing; Optimization; Problem solving; Routing algorithms; Business activities; Heuristic and genetic algorithms; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Logistics operations; Model and algorithms; Reverse logistics; Simultaneous pickup and deliveries; Vehicle Routing Problems; Genetic algorithms,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886937491

The authors' analysis divides returns into two categories: (1) controllable returns, which can be avoided or eliminated by actions taken by the company, and (2) uncontrollable returns, which companies can do little or nothing about in the short term. They then describe the five stages of the returns process - receive, sort and stage, process, analyze, support - and illustrate how companies as varied as Philips Consumer Electronics, Sierra Trading Post, Road Runner Sports, Altec Electronica Chihuahua, Sauder Woodworking and Estée Lauder minimize returns and their associated costs throughout the process by applying a variety of tactics, such as improvements in product quality, elimination of ""mispicks"" and shipping errors, and implementation of programs such as vendor-managed inventory, efficient consumer response and prepostponement.

This paper deals with the coordination issue of a selling channel for a short-fife-cycle product. First, a new type of contract combining the return policy with markdown money according to the practice under which some companies sell their products with different marketing policies in different selling periods is designed. This case is illustrated using a stochastic dynamic-programming model. Then, the necessary condition to achieve channel coordination with this combined contract is derived; and given the scheme to allocate the coordination profit, the generalized method to find the optimal contract parameters is developed. Lastly, with analysis and simulations, it can be concluded that the supply-chain coordination with the single contract in literatures for two-period selling depends on the demand distribution and the cost structure of a system, but the combined contract that was designed depends only on the cost structure of a system. It can further be concluded that the combined contract can ensure channel coordination and arbitrarily allocate coordination profit, and that the combined contract is generalized with several classical contracts as its special examples. Furthermore, the supplier will become the active initiator of the combined contract under the high-risk setting because the combined contract can strengthen his status in the channel system and improve his performance. © 2006 IEEE.",Combined contract; Dynamic-programming model; Short life cycle; Simulation; Supply-chain coordination,Computer simulation; Contracts; Dynamic programming; Life cycle; Mathematical models; Sales; Stochastic programming; Combined contract; Dynamic programming model; Short life cycle; Supply chain coordination; Marketing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-30444459933

They were enrolled at one metropolitan university in a southwestern state in the USA. A structural equation model using a correlation matrix with maximum likelihood was estimated by LISREL 8.53. Findings - Fashion involvement and positive emotion had positive effects on consumers' fashion-oriented impulse buying behavior with fashion involvement having the greatest effect.

Research limitations/implications - This study was limited to college students at one metropolitan university in a southwestern state in the USA and to general fashion products. Practical implications - Retailers may encourage consumers' positive emotion through strategies such as store design, product displays, package design, and sales. A focus on entertainment, interest, and excitement may be as important as getting the right mix of merchandise and pricing. Other retail strategies might be to stress the relative rationality and non-economic rewards of impulse buying in advertising efforts; to make impulse purchases more risk free through convenient return policies; and to increase enablers such as offering credit and extending store hours.

In conclusion, it is argued that the use of such an integrated supply chain approach offers significant opportunities to reduce the cost of reverse logistics operations while maximising asset recovery values. © 2007, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Cost management; Reverse logistics; Supply chain,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149167431

Methods: Retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively during the study period. The main outcome measures were whether or not patients were transfused with red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma or any blood product, the proportion of patients returned to theatre for investigation for post-operative bleeding and length of stay in the intensive care unit. We performed univariate analysis to identify the factors influencing the outcome measures and multivariate analysis to identify the effect of administration of tranexamic acid on the outcome measures. Results: Administration of tranexamic acid was an independent factor affecting the transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma or any blood product. It was also an independent factor influencing the rate of return to theatre for exploration of bleeding. The odds of receiving a transfusion or returning to theatre for bleeding were significantly lower in patients receiving tranexamic acid. The administration of tranexamic acid also significantly decreased blood loss. We did not find any association between the administration of tranexamic acid and the length of intensive care stay. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of 4191 patients who underwent a primary cardiac operation, administration of tranexamic acid decreased the number of patients exposed to a transfusion or returned to theatre for bleeding in our institute. © 2006 Vuylsteke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,acetylsalicylic acid; clopidogrel; fresh frozen plasma; tranexamic acid; adult; aged; article; blood transfusion; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; cryoprecipitate; erythrocyte transfusion; female; heart surgery; heart valve replacement; heart valve surgery; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; outcomes research; postoperative hemorrhage; practice guideline; reoperation; retrospective study; thrombocyte transfusion,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748864202

We develop three generic facility location models for the integrated distribution and collection of products that accommodate a variety of applications and industries. These models quantify the value of integrated decision making in the design of forward and reverse logistics networks throughout different stages of a product's life cycle. The formulations extend the uncapacitated fixed-charge location model to include the location of used product collection centers and the assignment of product return flows to these centers. In addition, we develop a Lagrangian relaxation-based solution algorithm that is both quick and effective. We measure the implications of integrated decision making by comparing the total facility and transportation costs of our joint optimization models with the cost of solutions in which forward and reverse facility location decisions are made sequentially or independently of one another. In addition, we discuss the implications of integrated decision making on network configuration and introduce a new network similarity measure to quantify this analysis.

The Markov decision models are formulated for both established companies that look at maximising average profit and start-up companies that look at maximising their long-term survival probability. We contrast both objectives, and present properties of the policies and the survival probabilities. We find that start-up companies may need to be riskier if the return price is very low, but there is a period where a start-up firm becomes more cautious than an established company and there is a point, as it accumulates capital, where it starts behaving as an established firm.

In this paper, we focus on the interaction between a manufacturer's reverse channel choice to collect postconsumer goods and the strategic product pricing decisions in the forward channel when retailing is competitive. To this end, we model a direct product collection system, in which the manufacturer collects used products directly from the consumers (e.g., print and copy cartridges) and an indirect product collection system, in which the retailers act as product return points (e.g., single-use cameras, cellular phones). We first examine how the allocation of product collection to retailers impacts their strategic behavior in the product market, and we discuss the economic trade-offs the manufacturer faces while choosing an optimal reverse channel structure. When a direct collection system is used, channel profits are driven by the impact of scale of returns on collection effort, whereas in the indirect reverse channel, supply chain profits are driven by the competitive interaction between the retailers. Subsequently, we show that the buy-back payments transfered to the retailers for postconsumer goods provide a wholesale pricing flexibility that can be used to price discriminate between retailers of different profitability. © 2006 INFORMS.",Distribution channels; Product remanufacturing; Reverse logistics; Supply chain coordination,Consumer products; Decision making; Management science; Product development; Reverse engineering; Strategic planning; Distribution channels; Product remanufacturing; Reverse logistics; Supply chain coordination; Retail stores,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33644518981

Research on end-of-life electronics returns has primarily focused on manual disassembly operations. In this paper, we focus on the scheduling problem for a facility with staging, manual disassembly operations, and bulk recycling, In bulk recycling, shredding or grinding reduces the size of the material fragments while magnetic, eddy current or other density separation techniques separate the material fragments. Unlike production, there are often no due dates in materials recovery processing. Recycles can sell the recovered materials to material commodity buyers at any time. However, recyclers wait to accumulate a shipment of material to reduce transportation costs and meet minimum sales quantities. Another important difference between production and recycling is that manufacturers purchase raw materials while recyclers may be paid to receive products. When due dates do not apply to scheduling products for materials recycling and product receipts generate revenue for recycling services, we propose two net metrics: the staging space turnover and the shipment fill time. We use our metrics to analyze new scheduling rules for disassembly and bulk recycling and to evaluate their performance. Using discrete-event simulation models, we test our scheduling rules on seven product families, where product families are defined based on material composition and separation operations. Of the rules we test, the disassembly scheduling rule which ranks product families based on the ratio of product size to disassembly time (SDT) most quickly empties the staging spaces. Shipment fill time is less sensitive to our scheduling rules.

The primary feature of this platform is a flexible scripting language that allows a researcher to implement any economics games in a relative short time. This scripting language eliminates the need to program low-level functions such as networking, databases and interface components. The scripts are description of games including definitions of roles, timing rules, the game tree (in a stage format), input and output (with respect to a role, not client software). Definitions of variables and the use of common mathematical and logical operations are also allowed to provide maximum flexibility in handling the logic of games. This platform has been used to implement a wide variety of business related games including variations of a retailer game with simulated consumers and complex business rules, a double sided call market and negotiation in a procurement scenario. These games are constructed to accurately simulate HP business environments. Carefully calibrated experiments, with human subjects whose incentives were controlled by monetary compensations, were conducted to test how different business strategies result in different market behavior. For example, the retailer game was used to test how the market reacts to changes of HP's contract terms such as return policies.

Such problems have been studied in the literature under the name cash management and relate to the variations of the on-hand cash balances of financial institutions. The possibility of a negative demand also models product returns in inventory systems. This article studies a model in which, in addition to standard ordering and scrapping decisions seen in the cash management models, the decision-maker can borrow and store some inventory for one period of time. For problems with back orders, zero setup costs, and linear ordering, scrapping, borrowing, and storage costs, we show that an optimal policy has a simple four-threshold structure. These thresholds, in a nondecreasing order, are order-up-to, borrow-up-to, store-down-to, and scrap-down-to levels; that is, if the inventory position is too low, an optimal policy is to order up to a certain level and then borrow up to a higher level. Analogously, if the inventory position is too high, the optimal decision is to reduce the inventory to a certain point, after which one should store some of the inventory down to a lower threshold. This structure holds for the finite and infinite horizon discounted expected cost criteria and for the average cost per unit time criterion. We also provide sufficient conditions when the bor-rowing and storage options should not be used. In order to prove our results for average costs per unit time, we establish sufficient conditions when the optimality equations hold for a Markov decision process with an uncountable state space, noncompact action sets, and unbounded costs.",,Inventory control; Markov processes; Average cost per unit time; Financial institution; Identically distributed random variables; Inventory systems; Markov Decision Processes; Optimal decisions; Optimality equation; Threshold policies; Decision making,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-12144273111

The other challenges in this field have been caused by the rapid development of e-commerce, the boom of online retailers, and the like. Again, companies bear enormous losses from huge returned products due to liberal return policies. In order to add customers' value, improve the relationship with customers and strengthen a company' s competitive advantages, there is a need for companies to find ways of how to reduce wastes and recover the value from used products for further utilities. Likewise, returned products also need to be aptly managed. All these challenges make reverse logistics a contemporary area of interest among managers and researchers of this field. First, it is proposed that the emergence of reverse logistics emanates from environmental concerns and economical drives. The connotation of reverse logistics is given in a narrow and a broad senses. The differences between reverse logistics and traditional forward logistics; and green logistics and closed-loop supply chain are analyzed. Moreover, reverse logistics' distinct characteristics such as: high uncertainties of supply on time, quantity and quality; complexities of recovery options and implementing barriers are pointed out in this paper. Next, using the qualitative and the quantitative case study analyses, the basic tenets of managerial and operational practices of reverse logistics are discussed in detail in this paper. Mathematical models have also been introduced to a great extent. Finally, the paper concludes by stating possible directions for further investigations on this subject. © Balkan Society of Geometers, Geometry Balkan Press 2005.",Recovery options; Recycling; Remanufacturing; Reuse; Reverse logistics,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21244495297

The high-performance product has the full function of the lower one, therefore the supplier can satisfy the demand of low-performance product with the higher one as it runs out. Recalling the manufacturing process of postponement strategy that consists of two periods: the one at the beginning for the common components and the other for differentiation as more information is available, we optimize this two-period dynamic decision process for downward substitutable products. Regarding the optimal behavior of the centralized supply chain as a benchmark, a bi-direction compensation contract with substitution premium is proposed for the decentralized system composed of a manufacturer and a retailer with local benefits. Through partly imposing the overproduction risk of the common components to the retailer, committing to buy back the overstocks and put a premium on each unit of substitution, the contract motivates the retailer to order as much as the centralized system's optimal output. Furthermore, this contract is not only effective to achieve coordination, but flexible to split the profit of the system between the channel members in an arbitrary ratio, thus the supply chain is expected to get Pareto-improving. © 2004 IEEE.",Compensation; Coordination; Downward substitution; Information updating; Return policy; Risk subsidy,Contracts; Costs; Decision theory; Dynamic programming; Forecasting; Inventory control; Manufacture; Mathematical models; Theorem proving; Compensation; Coordination mechanism; Downward substitution; Information updating; Return policy; Risk subsidy; Industrial management,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-15744384355

In this paper we discuss reverse distribution, and propose a mathematical programming model for a version of this problem. Due to the complexity of the proposed model, we introduce a heuristic solution methodology for this problem. The solution methodology complements a heuristic concentration procedure, where sub-problems with reduced sets of decision variables are iteratively solved to optimality. Based on the solutions from the sub-problems, a final concentration set of potential facility sites is constructed, and this problem is solved to optimality. The potential facility sites are then expanded in a greedy fashion to obtain the final solution. This ""heuristic expansion"" was also performed using the solution found with a greedy heuristic to provide a short-list of potential facility sites. Computational tests demonstrate a great deal of promise for this solution method, as high-quality solutions are obtained while expending modest computational effort. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",Facility location; Heuristics; Logistics; Mathematical programming; Reverse distribution,Computational methods; Heuristic methods; Problem solving; Set theory; Reverse distribution; Mathematical programming,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038241896

Exclusive suppliers often use simple returns policies for high-value products to persuade their independent dealers to stock and price items aggressively. For low-value products, a return policy problem occurs; dealer requests for low-value returns are routinely rejected. Because a manufacturer may make over 500 return request decisions per day, a fast algorithm is required. Two fast algorithms that evaluate multiple factors are presented and tested for six months against dealer inventory requests at heavy equipment manufacturer, Caterpillar, Inc. The results show that the proposed algorithms may eliminate nearly 1,000 back-orders per month. The results indicate that exclusive suppliers can modify their return policies to improve service to customers by analysing not only product value, but also inventory level and lead-time. © MCB UP Ltd.",Inventory; Lead times; Returns; Service improvements,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27844607535

This paper focuses on variation and its impact on the quality-failure costs—scrap, rework, extra labor, customer dissatisfaction, and product returns. In many cases, reducing quality failures requires an increase in product cost. Balancing these two costs is challenging because perfect information about process variability is rarely, if ever, available. As a result of process variation uncertainty, there is no clear optimal solution to the quality-failure cost/unit cost tradeoff. The author has observed that companies take one of two approaches to this dilemma: optimistic or pessimistic. The optimistic approach risks high rework costs to ensure the lowest cost product. On the other hand, the pessimistic approach forgoes potential unit cost reductions to avoid any quality failure. This paper presents a utility theory model of decision making under process capability uncertainty. This model is used to describe why either approach can be optimal depending on the organization, market, and product characteristics. In addition, information value theory is applied to explain the relative value of process capability information and variation reduction in the two approaches. The paper uses a frequently encountered design scenario to demonstrate the approach. In addition, a variety of other examples from industry are used to describe how the theory can be applied. © 2001 ASME.",Cost modeling; Information value theory; Quality; Robust design; Utility theory,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842626851

The model of manufacturer-retailer interaction assumes that the demand is uncertain but correlated across time periods. Thus, its true nature is revealed over time via the realization of sales. The speed of such learning depends on the size of the inventory at the retail level which in turn can be strategically influenced by the manufacturer through a returns policy.

Comparison between simulation results and existing space systems showed the validity of the proposed method.

Actually, in a game where retailers first order stocks and then compete by choosing prices, even if a manufacturer offers full return policies, the retailers can still use ""insufficient"" stocks as quantities precommitment in order to uphold retail prices. Hence, the retailers still face stock constraints at the final stage of the game. The nature of the game is essentially unaffected by returns policies when demand is certain.

To fill the void in such a line of research, this paper proposes a nonlinear mixed-integer programming model and a genetic algorithm that can solve the distribution problem with forward and reverse logistics simultaneously.

This is even more true for increasingly popular Internet sales where the opportunity to physically examine the product is absent. A tremendous advantage can be gained by the Internet firm if it could offer a return policy for BTO products. We propose the use of modularity in the product design as a solution to this problem. From manufacturer's point of view, following a policy of modularization and offering a generous return policy would increase revenue, but also increase the cost due to increased likelihood of return and increased cost of design. We develop a profit maximization model to jointly obtain optimal polices for return policy and modularity level in terms of certain market reaction parameters.

Attention is focused on interplanetary missions, but the method can be easily generalized to every space mission. Fuzzy logic has been selected to simulate the human thinking of several experts' teams in making refined choices within a universe of on-board subsystem solutions according to a set of a given sub-criteria generated by the general ""maximum product return"" goal. Among MCDM approaches, the Multi-Attribute (MADM) has been chosen to implement the proposed method, while the Multi-Objective (MODM) has been used to verify solutions in terms of optimality. Starting from an Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP), criteria relative importance is evaluated by a combination-sensitive weight vector obtained through a multi-level scheme. Uncertainty intrinsic in technical parameters is taken into account by managing all quantities with the interval algebra rules. Comparison between simulation results and already flown, flying or planned to fly space systems showed a satisfactory mapping of the actual spacecraft, drastically reducing the time dedicated to the preliminary spacecraft design. Moreover, the ranking of the feasible configurations reveals to be as sensitive as humans in perceiving changes even in a single technical parameter value. The suggested preliminary spacecraft configuration cardinality is also consistent with the optimum detected by the MODM approach: the lower a configuration preference index is, the nearer that configuration to the optimum -according to an Euclidean metric - in the criteria iper-space.",,Automation; Computer simulation; Decision making; Fuzzy sets; Optimization; Systems analysis; Multi-criteria decison making (MCDM); Interplanetary spacecraft,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036075361

These minimum cost reverse supply chains often do not consider product return speed. The longer it takes to retrieve a returned product, the lower the chances that there are financially attractive reuse options. Unlike forward supply chains, design strategies for reverse supply chains are unexplored and largely undocumented. The most influential product characteristic for reverse supply chain design is the marginal value of time. Responsive reverse supply chains are the appropriate choice when the marginal value of time for products is high, and efficient reverse supply chains are the proper choice when the marginal value of time for products is low.

This use of option theory provides retailers with a framework to optimize the price and the return option independently and under various market conditions. This separation of product price and option value enables retailers to offer an unbundled MBG policy, that is, to allow the customer to choose whether to purchase an MBG option with the product or to buy the product without the MBG but at a lower price. The option value of having an MBG is negatively correlated with the likelihood of product fit and with the opportunity to test the product before purchase, and positively correlated with price and contract duration. Simulation of our model reveals that when customers are highly heterogeneous in their product valuation and probability of need-fit, and if return costs are low, an unbundled MBG policy is optimal. When customers have high likelihood of fit or return costs are excessive, no MBG is the best policy. When customers have small variance in product valuation, but vary greatly in likelihood of product fit, the retailer may prefer to offer a bundled MBG contract, extracting consumer surplus by charging a price close to the valuation level. © 2002 by New York University.

The framework draws on research in consumer choice, consumer memory, and attitude stability to predict how the process that consumers go through at a predecisional stage affects their postpurchase behavior. The likelihood of product returns is considered contingent on the amount and nature of cognitive responses generated during the choice process. In Study 1, the authors focus on the impact of the nature of cognitive responses and show that the generation of responses of a different nature while choosing directly affects the likelihood of choice reversal. The comparative versus noncomparative nature of thoughts generated influences their diagnosticity and, accordingly, their impact on product returns when consumers are exposed to disconfirming information. In Study 2, the authors draw on the inoculation theory to manipulate the number of prechoice thoughts. They find that when faced with disconfirming information favoring a new brand, inoculated consumers who are presented with choice alternatives sequentially are less likely to return a brand than consumers who are exposed solely to positive information about the chosen brand at a prepurchase stage.",,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-24344462734

These companies are eventually forced to face the enormous amount of problems at the back of their business, which increase significantly when they are not managed correctly. Because of this reason, RL has recently been considered as an improvement area if it is focused correctly. Every manufacturing, distribution or sales firm, irrespective of its size, types of products or geographic location, can benefit from planning, implementing and controlling RL activities. Unfortunately, not enough analytical models currently exist which assist in RL strategic decisions. One of such critical decisions in RL systems can be identified as whether or not to outsource these activities to a Third-Party Reverse Logistics Provider (3PRLP). Extensive research has been performed in relation to outsourcing logistics functions, but not enough on the specific case of RL activities. Furthermore, once the decision to outsource a defined set of RL functions has been taken, the selection of a 3PRLP is a critical issue to consider too. One characteristic that distinguishes RL from the forward supply chain is the high uncertainty in the product return rate. The analytical model presented addresses the outsourcing decision-making problem mentioned above by considering two factors: the length of the product life cycle and the variability in the rate of returns between consecutive periods. A Markov Decision Model (MDM) is proposed to help a firm to decide whether or not to follow an outsourcing strategy for its RL activities. The reasons to consider these two factors are clearly explained, as well as the way this MDM can be applied to a company that manufactures a defined set of products and faces the problem of managing the RL flow for all of them. In particular, the electronics sector is analyzed, considering the short lifecycles of the products managed by these firms, and the significantly high variability in the rate of returns between consecutive periods. The characteristic economic conditions in this market are included, considering the product's decreasing price in the secondary market over time. The results show under which conditions it is economically desirable to follow an outsourcing strategy, and how great will be the expected economic advantage by following this option rather than performing the activities internally. Finally, how the proposed model can be extended to other industrial sectors (such as retailers or pharmaceutical with different combinations of product lifecycle length and return variability) where RL also represents a critical issue is shown too.",Electronics reuse; Outsourcing; Reverse Logistics,Life cycle; Markov processes; Outsourcing; Planning; Product lifecycle; Reverse logistics (RL); Supply chain; Decision theory,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-30044443981

The interplay of these two factors gives rise to four possible strategic scenarios. We show that sellers' strategy is clearly explainable in three out of these four scenarios. In the ambiguous fourth scenario, we show that sellers' strategy for information production goods will differ considerably from information consumption goods based on product complexity and cost of product return (borne by the buyer).

In this article, the authors develop a framework to examine bargaining between channel members and demonstrate that the bargaining process actually affects the degree of coordination and that two-part tariffs will not be part of the market contract even in a simple one manufacturer-one retailer channel. To establish the institutional and theoretical bases for these results, the authors relax the conventional assumption that the product being exchanged is completely specifiable in a contract. They show that the institution of bargaining has force, and it affects channel coordination when the complexity of nonspecifiability of the product exchange is present. The authors find that greater retailer power promotes channel coordination. Thus, there are conditions in which the presence of a powerful retailer might actually be beneficial to all channel members. The authors recover the standard double-marginalization take-it-or-leave-it offer outcome as a particular case of the bargaining process. They also examine the implications of relative bargaining powers for whether the product is delivered ""early"" (i.e., before demand is realized) or ""late"" (i.e., delivered to the retailer only if there is demand).

There are constraints on the service level. We use a stylized two-stage GI/G/1 queuing network model to study the problem. The first stage is unique to each product, whereas remanufactured and new products share the second stage. The objective was to find the optimal, long run production mix that maximizes profit subject to a service-level constraint that restricts the average order lead-time. There is yield in the remanufacturing process, where yield is the per cent of returned used products that result in a good part after remanufacturing. In the analytic model, we make the simplifying assumption that the producer always gets enough return of used products to meet its remanufacturing needs in the production mix. However, we relax this assumption in a simulation. We find that the optimal solution is generally non-trivial, i.e. the firm generally uses a mix of remanufactured and new products to meet demand. When the new product is less profitable than the remanufactured product, then it is optimal to remanufacture 100%, provided that there is enough supply of used products. When the new product is more profitable, however, the proportion of remanufacturing increases as service level increases. We use simulation to test the robustness of the analytic model by including complexities such as stochastic product returns and stochastic production yield.",,Computer aided manufacturing; Computer simulation; Constraint theory; Mathematical models; Queueing networks; Random processes; Remanufacturing; Stochastic product returns; Stochastic product yield; Process engineering,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037138029

Thirty-six of the 60 questionnaires (60%) were returned by mail and the reminded were completed in personal visits to the CCCs achieving a response rate of 100%. About half (51.7%) used ""common sense"" and ""personal feelings"" to exclude children and to allow their return, and 29 (48.3%) used the guidelines of the Ministries of Education and Health or other authorities. The percentage of centers excluding children by signs/symptoms was as follows: high fever (>38°C), 100%; low-grade fever, 76.7%; asthma exacerbation, 80.0%; heavy cough, 75.0%; eye discharge or conjunctivitis, 83.3%; diarrhea and vomiting more than twice per day, 100%; rash, 72.3%; otalgia, 46.7%; and infected skin lesion, 66.7%.

These two decisions are separated by a period of time, and crucial experiential information often is available only at the second decision point (i.e., after receipt). Consumers' initial lack of experiential information makes product choice more risky. Return policy leniency is one way to minimize the inherent consumer risk, but retailers may avoid instituting overtly lenient policies because they expect increased return rates. However, the endowment effect suggests some surprising benefits of return policy leniency to the retailer.

The retailer chooses inventories ex ante and promotional effort ex post. If the wholesale price exceeds marginal production cost, the retailer orders fewer than the joint profit-maximizing inventories. If the manufacturer attempts to coordinate inventories by buying back unsold units, then the retailer's promotional incentives are dulled. Under very general assumptions on the form of the effort function, we show that buy-backs adversely affect supply chain profits, and higher buy-back prices imply lower profits. Also, while a buy-back alone cannot coordinate the channel, coupling buy-backs with promotional cost-sharing agreements (if effort cost is observable), offering unilateral markdown allowances ex post (if demand is observable but not verifiable), or placing additional constraints on the buy-back (if demand is observable and verifiable) does result in coordination. This problem is not limited to returns policies but is shown to hold for a much larger set of contracts. The results are quite robust (e.g., when the retailer chooses effort before observing demand), but coordinating contracts become more problematic if, for example, the retailer also stocks substitutes for the manufacturer's product.

The investigation of pricing strategies between an upstream manufacturer and downstream retailer has always been based on factors such inventory cost and return policies. Digital products such as music and software neither suffer from storage costs nor can they be returned for a salvage price. Further, even if consumer preferences for the products are known the demand can still be stochastic when consumers' piracy behavior is unknown. This research provides a first model of digital product manufacturer-retailer relationship and develops pricing strategies under two payment policies, first, when a manufacturer is prepaid for his intellectual property and second, when he is paid on a per-copy sold basis. The implication of these two policies on the quality and price of the digital product is discussed in the context of piracy.",digital products; entertainment industries; piracy; pricing; software; Stackelberg; supply chain,Computer software; Costs; Crime; Electronic commerce; Manufacture; Sales; Strategic planning; Supply chain management; Consumer preferences; Digital products; Entertainment industry; Inventory costs; Little research; Operations management; Payment policy; Physical products; piracy; Pricing strategy; Return policy; Stackelberg; Storage costs; Supply chains,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954490356

After their life span most of the galvanized products return as scrap to the steel mill. During the steel process the zinc is collected in the flue dust. It is astonishing to notice that between 40 and 50% of the zinc produced is brought into the steel processing cycle by the coated scrap while only 3 to 5% of the zinc production can be covered by the recycling of the zinc-bearing steel mill dusts. Responsible for this worse ratio is the fact that the established recycling technologies suffer from high energy consumption, low zinc yields, halogen problems and hardly any iron recovery. A development of new or an optimization of current recycling procedures for the dusts is unalterable because of increasing zinc amounts in these residues and the rising costs for the disposal. Different pyrometallurgical recycling technologies are tested in rotary kilns and vertical retorts at the Department of Nonferrous Metallurgy, University of Leoben, Austria. Various reducing agents from carbon monoxide to hydrogen and combinations are used. The results should make it possible to draw conclusions that allow an economical and ecological judgement of the different varieties. The goal is to support the affected industry to increase the low recycling rate and prevent a loss of high zinc values in the steel industry filter dusts.",,Agents; Dust; Flues; Galvanizing; Iron and steel plants; Metal recovery; Optimization; Recycling; Steel scrap; Flue dusts; Reducing agents; Steel industry filter dusts; Steel mill dusts; Pyrometallurgy,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141571388

This article suggests that changes in consumer behavior/retail return policies may be the result of a larger social phenomenon: consumer anomie. This research explores consumer anomie within the context of retailing. Two studies assess the relationships between anomie, materialism, rationalization techniques, and fraudulent marketplace behaviors. Factor analysis corroborates previous research indicating that modern-day anomie is essentially cynicism. Consumers high in cynicism are more materialistic and more likely than other consumers to employ rationalization techniques in order to justify engaging in unethical retail disposition. Consumers high in cynicism are also found to hold more favorable views toward engaging in fraudulent marketplace behaviors that permit them to benefit at the seller's expense. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2442566652

This increases the likelihood that customers will have some dissatisfaction with the product and would like to return it. A clearly explained and generous return policy, then, will be welcome by the customers and therefore will enhance demand. From the manufacturer's point of view, this will increase revenue, but will also increase cost due to increased likelihood of return.

We show that the acquisition of used products may be used as the control lever for the management and profitability of reuse activities. These activities, termed product acquisition management, affect several important business decisions. First, if a firm is to pursue reuse activities, these reuse activities must be value-creating. Second, if a firm is to compete by offering remanufactured products, then we show how product returns management influences the overall profitability of such activities via a trial and error EVA® approach.

This study examined the influence of dressing changes on wound temperature. METHOD: The wound-bed temperatures of patients with a wound resulting from trauma or surgical debridement were measured immediately before and after dressing changes using a DermaTemp infrared body surface scanning device. The temperature on the surface of the dressing product was measured immediately before the dressing change and then every five minutes it until the pre-procedural temperature was reached. RESULTS: A total of 133 dressing episodes were measured, yielding 266 wound-bed temperature measurements and 619 external dressing temperature measurements. Pre-procedural temperatures showed that the wound beds were on average marginally below the 33 degrees C threshold immediately after dressing takedown (mean: 32.7 degrees C). This figure dropped two degrees on average as a result of the dressing-change procedure (mean: 29.9 degrees C). Reapplied wound-dressing products return to the pre-procedural temperature within 30 minutes (mean: 23 minutes). CONCLUSION: This study provides baseline data for future research aimed at promoting maintenance of a normothermic wound bed.

We first study the retailer-DSO coordination issues. The products are initially sold in a retail outlet. After the selling season, the leftovers are moved to a DSO for a permanent clearance sale. When the retailer and the DSO coordinate, they share information on the demand forecast and jointly decide the stocking, markdown sales, and return policies to maximize mutual profit. In the absence of coordination, the demand information is not shared by the two parties, and the decisions are decentralized to optimize the individual party's objective function. For the supplier-retailer-DSO cooperation issue, two models are considered: namely, the Joint Optimal Model (JOM) and the Individual Optimal Model (IOM), respectively. In the IOM, the stocking, markdown sales, and return policies are individually designed by the retailer-DSO, while the supplier independently sets the terms of the return policy. We compare this approach with the JOM, in which the supplier-retailer-DSO jointly designs a mutually beneficial plan so as to maximize the supply chain joint profit. Optimal coordination policies are analyzed, and the factors that make coordination an effective approach are studied. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Distribution; Inventory; Marketing; Supply chain management,Decision making; Decision theory; Inventory control; Marketing; Mathematical models; Resource allocation; Sales; Strategic planning; Joint optimal model (JOM); Supply chain management; Operations research,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035897985
