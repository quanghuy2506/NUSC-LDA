              "       'the rise of digital technologies and online business models has fundamentally changed the shopping environment. in line with e-commerce growth, product returns increased to double-digit percentages, constituting a risk for the retailer’s profitability. the main cause lies within product uncertainty, as consumers cannot physically assess and try on products. previous research differentiates between product quality and fit uncertainty, where the latter has a stronger effect on product returns. to counteract, retailers can implement signals to convey additional product information. while quality-inferring signals, such as brands, have been studied extensively, little is known about signals supporting product fit. we research a technology specifically designed to reduce fit uncertainty, namely virtual try-ons (vtos), exploring how their usage impacts consumer purchase behavior, especially sales and returns, considering different product types. the analysis is based on a unique clickstream and customer transaction dataset from a european e-commerce retailer comprising over 1.3 million purchases in 2020. results indicate that the usage of vtos increases sales, in particular order value, the number of items per order, average selling prices, and contribution margins, as well as reduces returns. these relationships are fortified for hedonic vs. utilitarian goods. we validate previously posed hypotheses that interactive technologies perform better in serving retailers’ desired outcomes than static decision aids, indicating that these provide superior product fit information, function as a signal, and hence reduce online product uncertainty more effectively. we are among the firsts to analyze the influence of try-on technology usage on purchasing behavior and extend expectation-disconfirmation and signaling theory to the digital marketing context. moreover, we contribute methodologically by analyzing large-scale data, adding realism to technology usage studies, which primarily leverage purchase intentions and laboratory settings. further, marketers can gain a better understanding of customer interactions with a new technology that promotes beneficial top-and bottom-line implications. © 2023, the author(s), under exclusive license to springer nature switzerland ag.',\n",

              "       'this work considers an omnichannel retailer selling a product with market demand uncertainties to customers in different regions through an e-store and multiple brick-and-mortar stores. the retailer also manages online product returns by selecting appropriate return policies. a robust omnichannel pricing and ordering optimization model is proposed with two, i.e., a full-refund and a no-refund, return policies. the online demand and the offline demand depend on the prices of the e-store and the brick-and-mortar stores, where the online demand also depends on the refund of the e-store. a linearization technique is adopted to deal with nonlinearity of the model. a data-driven robust optimization approach is used to construct uncertainty sets based on available historical data using support vector clustering to handle demand uncertainties. furthermore, the proposed model is transformed into an approximate mixed integer linear programming model which can be solved by using commercial software. an electronics retailer in china is used as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model and the solution method. a comparison with the box uncertainty set reveals that the data-driven uncertainty set is less conservative and performs better by obtaining higher profit for the retailer. furthermore, sensitive analysis results indicate that return policies and the return rate of the product affect the optimal pricing and ordering decisions and the total profit. © 2022 elsevier b.v.',\n",

              "       'due to the absence of physical evaluation in online shopping, consumers have no idea about the exact value of products. in recent years, the business model of “weblebrity marketing” has been widely introduced by online brands to alleviate consumers′ uncertainty about product value. weblebrities with influence and product selection skills are hired to promote and sell products to consumers in real time on livestreaming platforms. as proven, the collaboration between weblebrities and brands is a success and brings huge benefits. in the pre-sale on november 11, 2021, li jiaqi and viya reached a cumulative trading value of rmb 10. 653 billion and 8. 552 billion, respectively. however, the prosperity of “weblebrity marketing” combines some things to watch out for. compared with the previous sales model, “weblebrity marketing” is frequently accompanied by a higher return rate. china consumer news reported an alarming return rate of 40% for some weblebrities. according to a report published by china consumers association in 2020, 60. 5% of respondents who refuse to buy through “weblebrity marketing” were concerned about the quality of products, and 44. 1% felt there was an extensive impulse purchase. when selling products, brands are not sure whether their products are of high or low value to consumers. after the production selection of weblebrities, brands enter into a partnership with them and have them convince consumers in the market that the products are of high value. through observation, there are two types of consumers, namely rational consumers and impulsive consumers. based on prior information about a product′s value and the weblebrity′s ability to select products, rational consumers perform bayesian updates to get posterior information about the product and decide whether to buy it or not. impulse consumers, by contrast, buy into the hype of weblebrities. for each transaction, the weblebrity is rewarded with a commission. after receiving the product, consumers decide whether to return it based on its true value. where returns occur, they have to pay certain costs (e. g. hassle and mailing costs) before being refunded in full. the brand will receive the product, but will not ask the weblebrity to return the commission for the transaction. in spite of the academic concerns about “ weblebrity marketing”, scholars have mostly conducted research through qualitative rather than quantitative analysis. in view of this, this paper builds a mathematical model to address the following two questions: (1) how does the ability of weblebrities to select products affect the pricing and profitability of brands? (2) how does the proportion of impulsive consumers in the market affect the pricing and profitability of brands? in this paper, a bayesian update model of consumers is established. through the sales model of “weblebrity marketing”, brands sell their products to a market of rational and impulsive consumers. watching the weblebrities′ judgment on the value of products, consumers are faced with the first decision-making, i. e., to buy or to give up. after the purchase, consumers decide whether to return or keep the product. impulsive consumers completely trust weblebrities′ propaganda, while rational consumers make estimates of product value based on a priori information and weblebrities′ product selection ability. according to their behavior in the marketplace, consumers are classified into three types: (1) type a, who keeps all the products they buy, regardless of their actual value; (2) type b, who keeps the high-value products they buy and return the low-value ones; and (3) type c, who returns all the products they buy. it goes in a sequence that: weblebrities announce the high value of products, rational and impulsive consumers enter the market and decide whether to buy the products, weblebrities make profits, rational and impulsive consumers decide whether to return the products, and brands make profits. this paper identifies how weblebrities′ product selection ability and impulse consumers′ proportion in the market affect brands′ profitability, especially brands should work with weblebrities with what selection ability and they should develop what pricing strategies in markets with different proportions of impulse consumers. conclusions are: first, brands′ profits are non-monotonically correlated with weblebrities′ product selection ability at low proportions of impulse consumers; incrementally correlated with weblebrities′ product selection ability at high proportions of impulse consumers. second, brands′ profits are decreasingly correlated with impulse consumers′ proportion at low selection ability of weblebrities; non-monotonically correlated with impulse consumers′ proportion at medium selection ability of weblebrities; and increasingly correlated with impulse consumers′ proportion at high selection ability of weblebrities. the findings have considerable implications for management: first, brands should minimize returns by reducing consumer uncertainty about product value rather than changing prices. second, in the product sales model of “weblebrity marketing”, brands should attach importance to weblebrities′ product selection ability and impulse consumers′ proportion in the market. specifically, markets with a small proportion of impulsive consumers are more beneficial to brands when the weblebrities they cooperate with are less able to select products. the more impulse consumers there are, the lower the price of products. conversely, markets with a large proportion of impulsive consumers are more beneficial to brands when the selected weblebrities are good at selecting products. the more impulse consumers there are, the higher the price should be. lastly, the higher the commission for weblebrities they cooperate with, the lower the price brands should set © 2023, journal of industrial engineering and engineering management.all rights reserved.',\n",

              "       'when an online manufacturer suffers from demand reduction and product return caused by product fit uncertainty, it could display products in a retailer’s store to provide the chance for consumers to examine whether the product fits their needs. according to whether the product the retailer sells is noncompetitive or competitive, this study considers that there are cooperation and co-opetition strategies for the online manufacturer to realize an offline showroom partnership. in addition, the retailer would provide retail service for consumers who visit the store, while the service cost information is private. thus, this study explores the optimal offline showroom partnership for an online manufacturer under information asymmetry. the results show that although partnering with a competitive retailer causes product competition, the online manufacturer would prefer the co-opetition strategy if (i) the competition intensity between the two products is low or (ii) the competition intensity is high and the cost to handle the returned product is low, and would prefer the cooperation strategy otherwise. under the optimal strategy, the online manufacturer should design the contract according to the return handling cost. nevertheless, the online manufacturer could set a higher price under the co-opetition strategy than that under the cooperation strategy. after comparing the online manufacturer’s optimal strategies and profits in different information environments, we find that product competition could reduce the online manufacturer’s profit loss caused by information asymmetry under certain conditions, and the online manufacturer with low return handling cost is more willing to adopt the co-opetition strategy under information asymmetry. © 2022 taylor & francis group, llc.',\n",
              "       \"within the rather nascent literature stream examining product returns, the authors identify that the vast majority of studies enlightens return avoidance measures (before ordering), whereas return averting measures (after purchasing) showed to increase customer satisfaction the most. moreover, extant literature is characterized by methodological paucity, which prevents a more diverse view on the problem of product returns. as a result, the authors enrich the literature by conducting a best-worst scaling (bws) experiment dealing with various product averting measures (including different types of measures with different levels of immediacy). focusing on the most frequent online shopping segment (generation y) and the second most frequently occurring reason for product returns (i.e., consumers did not like the product), the authors exploratively evince that monetary/ utilitarian measures are preferred most and are effective, as well as funding of social and sustainability projects. however, substantial differences were detected based on consumers' green consumption values. apart from that, the study contributes to the bws literature by outlining the necessity to include anchor scaling and quality assessment criteria. © 2023 c.h.beck ohg. all rights reserved.\",\n",
              "       'in order to solve the problem of separation between consumer purchase and product experience in online sales, live streaming e-commerce came into being. however, the interaction of streamers is easy to cause consumers’ impulse consumption, which leads to the soaring return rate. in this context, how to make reasonable return policies to avoid the loss is an important issue for brands. this paper studies return policy selection for brands. we mainly focus on mcn (multi-channel network) click farming and customer disappointment aversion in the situations that the return-freight insurances are paid by brands or consumers or brands and mcn jointly. three leader-follower models with brands as leaders and platforms and mcn as followers are established. to solve the above bilevel models, we discuss the conditions under which the upper and lower models are both convex and, based on these theoretical results, we give the optimal strategies for all members. then, through numerical experiments, we analyze the impacts of customer disappointment aversion level, mcn’s ability, commission rate, brand’s return-freight insurance purchasing ratio, and other factors on each member’s optimal decision. the results show that the return policy in the situation of return-freight insurance paid by brand is suitable for a market with the high level of customer disappointment aversion; the return policy in the situation of return-freight insurance paid by consumers is applicable to the case of low customer disappointment aversion and high commission rate; the return policy in the situation of return-freight insurance paid by brand and mcn jointly is suitable for the case of low mcn capability and can effectively restrain the click farming from mcn. © 2022 by the authors.'],\n",
